That challenge had 73 participants, including 10 people who provided 20 or more correct answers to open support threads, thereby winning the challenge. Congratulations to Harris Anastasiadis, Ahmad Awais, Takis Bouyouris, Phil Erb, Eric Gunawan, Jackie McBride, Diana Nichols, Kostas Nicolacopoulos, Juhi Saxena, and Sarah Semark! To them and to everyone else who participated, thank you <strong>so much</strong> for your efforts. Every answer helps, and over the course of this contributor weekend, these amazing volunteers responded to <strong>800 support threads</strong>. The support forums queue of requests with no replies went from 28 pages to 7 pages &#8212; that was an incredible success, of which every participant was a part!</p>\n<p>So head on over to see how to <a href="https://wp.me/P6onIa-28D">get involved with the one-hour video challenge</a> this weekend, and help us make next month&#8217;s post just as impressive! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="?" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:41:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n	\n\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"WordPress 4.5 Beta 1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/02/wordpress-4-5-beta-1/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 03:27:13 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Development";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"4.5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4080";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:329:"WordPress 4.5 Beta 1 is now available!

Sometimes people don&#8217;t realize that WordCamps are organized by local volunteers rather than a central organization, and they contact us asking, &#8220;Can you bring WordCamp to my city?&#8221; When this happens, we always suggest they start with a meetup group, and think about organizing a WordCamp themselves after their group has been active for a few months. We emphasize that WordCamps are locally-organized events, not something that the central <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community">community team</a> plans from afar.</p>\n<p>This has been successful in many areas &#8212; there are currently 241 meetup groups on our meetup.com chapter program! In some regions, though, enthusiastic volunteers have had more of a challenge getting things started. Because of this, we&#8217;re going to try an experiment this year called the WordCamp Incubator.</p>\n<p>The intention of the incubator program is to help spread WordPress to underserved areas through providing more significant organizing support for a first event. In practical terms, this experiment means we&#8217;ll be choosing three cities in 2016 where there is not an active WordPress community &#8212; but where it seems like there is a lot of potential and where there are some people excited to become organizers &#8212; and will help to organize their first WordCamp. These WordCamps will be small, one-day, one-track events geared toward the goal of generating interest and getting people involved in creating an ongoing local community.*</p>\n<p>So, where should we do these three events?  If you have always wanted a WordCamp in your city but haven&#8217;t been able to get a meetup group going, this is a great opportunity. We will be taking applications for the next week, then will get in touch with everyone who applied to discuss the possibilities. We will announce the  cities chosen by the end of March.</p>\n<p>To apply, <a href="http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/wordcamp-incubator-application">fill in the application</a> by February 26, 2016. You don&#8217;t need to have any specific information handy, it&#8217;s just a form to let us know you&#8217;re interested. You can apply to nominate your city even if you don&#8217;t want to be the main organizer, but for this experiment  we will need local liaisons and volunteers, so please only nominate cities where you live or work so that we have at least one local connection to begin.</p>\n<p>Thanks, and good luck!</p>\n<p><em><strong>* </strong>For the record, that describes the ideal first WordCamp even if you have an active meetup &#8212; there&#8217;s no need to wait until your group is big enough to support a large multi-day event, and small events are a lot of fun because everyone has a chance to be involved and get to know most of the other attendees.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:36:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"WordPress 4.4.2 Security and Maintenance Release";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/02/wordpress-4-4-2-security-and-maintenance-release/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 02 Feb 2016 17:57:13 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Security";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4065";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:375:"WordPress 4.4.2 is now available.

The 19-year old developer from India already has 17 plugins and four themes to his credit on WordPress.org. We recently featured his work on the <a href="http://wptavern.com/write-css-in-the-customizer-with-the-advanced-css-editor-plugin" target="_blank">Advanced CSS Editor</a> plugin, which allows users to write CSS in the customizer.</p>\n<p>Latte follows suit with extensive customizer options for every section of the one-page scrolling theme. It was created for developers, designers, and freelancers who want to feature their work in a visual resume format with a profile photo, short bio, services, newsletter subscription, and more. Each of these sections are optional and can be turned on/off with a simple checkbox in the customizer.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/latte-customizer.png"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/latte-customizer.png?resize=1025%2C578" alt="latte-customizer" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53019" /></a></p>\n<p>Latte theme users can choose to highlight different skills, portfolio items, blog posts, and/or services they provide. It is geared towards individuals who want to lead with their profile and keep all their relevant information on the home page.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/skills-portfolio.png"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/skills-portfolio.png?resize=1025%2C664" alt="skills-portfolio" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53023" /></a></p>\n<p>In many one-page scrolling themes, blog posts become somewhat of an afterthought that don&#8217;t receive the same design attention. Latte, on the other hand, includes a simple, tasteful single post design that is harmonious with the rest of the site. A blog header image can be set in the customizer to be unique or match the rest of the site.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/latte-single-post.png"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/latte-single-post.png?resize=1025%2C647" alt="latte-single-post" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53028" /></a></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not a fan of the preloader or the scrolling parallax animations, you can disable them in the customizer. The theme supports a slide-out navigation menu, which can also be disabled if you plan to keep all the content on the homepage without posting any blogs.</p>\n<p>Asrani built 100+ color control options into the theme and prides himself on its customizability. Latte&#8217;s homepage states that if you find something in the theme which is not customizable, then he will work on adding it to the theme.</p>\n<p>The services, skills, and subscribe sections are widgetized areas where the content is generated by special widgets that are included in the theme. <a href="https://themes.svn.wordpress.org/latte/0.6/documentation/Latte%20Documentation.pdf" target="_blank">Documentation</a> for setting up the various sections is included in the theme&#8217;s zip file. If you want to add pricing tables, a contact form, portfolio section, or a map, you&#8217;ll need to purchase the pro version. To Asrani&#8217;s credit, the free version is not cluttered by pro version &#8220;teaser&#8221; controls in the customizer.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.hardeepasrani.com/demo/latte/" target="_blank">live demo</a> to see each of the available sections in action on the page.</p>\n<p>Latte offers a welcome alternative to clunky, confusing page builders or drag-and-drop editors. With everything in the customizer, the user doesn&#8217;t have to hunt around for how to edit its many sections. If you want a simple one-page theme to showcase your profile and services, you&#8217;d be hard pressed to find one more customizable than Latte. <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/latte/" target="_blank">Download</a> it for free from WordPress.org or via your admin themes browser.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 30 Mar 2016 19:04:50 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"WPTavern: A Little Communication Goes a Long Way";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52977";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"http://wptavern.com/a-little-communication-goes-a-long-way";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4926:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/CommunicationFeaturedImage.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-15569" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/CommunicationFeaturedImage.jpg?resize=637%2C200" alt="Communication Featured Image" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/elycefeliz/3224486233/">elycefeliz</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p>Whether you manage WordPress plugins, themes, or a service, a key component to keeping users happy is communication. Users and especially paying customers want to know what&#8217;s going on. Going an extended period of time without communicating leads to doubt, a feeling of abandonment, and speculation.</p>\n<p>Communicating is not hard and these days, developers have more ways than ever to keep users and customers informed. If you&#8217;re experiencing writer&#8217;s block or don&#8217;t know what to write about, here are a few ideas.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New Features</li>\n<li>Major Bug Fixes</li>\n<li>White Papers</li>\n<li>User Testimonials/Reviews</li>\n<li>Major Changes or Announcements</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The key is to maintain a cycle where you communicate, users and customers provide feedback, and implement the feedback into continued improvements. While it doesn&#8217;t always work this way, it&#8217;s an ideal strategy that keeps developers and users on the same page.</p>\n<h2>Controlling The Flow of Information</h2>\n<p>Ideally, a news site is not the first place users should discover what&#8217;s going on with a particular project. Blogs attached to a project&#8217;s site are an excellent way to keep insiders and outsiders informed. By utilizing Facebook, Twitter, change logs, and a blog, you control the flow of information and what you want people to know.</p>\n<p>Speaking of change logs, last year, <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-developers-need-to-communicate-better-in-change-logs">I offered advice</a> on what information to include and how to differentiate between the changes. Users read change logs and should be an important part of any developer&#8217;s communication strategy.</p>\n<h2>How Much Communication?</h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s no set rule on how much you should communicate but with all the options available, there&#8217;s no excuse not to push out a few updates a week. However, this all depends on how many users you have, how much development activity is going on, etc. Sometimes, there&#8217;s nothing to report and that&#8217;s fine. When it becomes concerning is when there is a lack of communication after a month or more.</p>\n<h2>Communication Can Make or Break a Business</h2>\n<p>Most of what I&#8217;ve discussed so far deals with software development. However, there is one aspect of communication that can make or break a business and that&#8217;s during a security issue.</p>\n<p>If your plugin, theme, or service experiences a security issue, the best thing to do is own it, be as transparent as possible, and inform users immediately. A great example is when <a href="https://ithemes.com/2014/09/23/important-security-update-for-all-customers/">iThemes experienced a security breach</a> in late 2014, that affected approximately 60,000 customers.</p>\n<p>iThemes CEO Cory Miller could have swept the breach under the rug and fix things behind the scenes but instead, chose to <a href="http://wptavern.com/ithemes-suffers-security-breach-customers-urged-to-reset-passwords">immediately inform customers</a>. In his post, he explains what happened, takes full responsibility, and explains what they&#8217;re going to do to make things right.</p>\n<p>As the company learned more about the breach, they shared that information with customers and the public. Thanks to Miller’s honest approach of attacking the issue head on, a lot of upset customers pledged their support for the company.</p>\n<h2>Be Honest</h2>\n<p>If iThemes chose to keep the breach under wraps for as long as possible, chances are that at some point it would be exposed likely causing the company irreparable damage. Humans are not perfect and security vulnerabilities happen, but it&#8217;s how they&#8217;re handled that can make or break a business.</p>\n<p>Be honest with yourself and to those giving you money. Nothing good happens by ignoring customers or setting unrealistic expectations.</p>\n<p>As the user and customer base of plugins, themes, and services increases, so does the impact of communication.

A current meta team <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/02/25/plugin-directory-v3/" target="_blank">initiative</a> is focused on improving search, including prioritizing translated plugins for international users, and streamlining plugin submission, among other improvements. This <a href="http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-plugin-directory-is-getting-a-makeover" target="_blank">major overhaul</a> is slated to be finished at the end of June 2016.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, WordPress.org plugin author <a href="http://mickeykaycreative.com/" target="_blank">Mickey Kay</a> has created a plugin that he intends to be the go-to resource for plugin and theme authors looking for a better management experience. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-dev-dashboard/" target="_blank">WP Dev Dashboard</a> plugin offers statistics for all of your WordPress.org plugins and themes in one convenient dashboard, along with a list of unresolved support requests.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/wp-dev-dashboard.gif"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/wp-dev-dashboard.gif?resize=1025%2C814" alt="wp-dev-dashboard" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52980" /></a></p>\n<p>In a post titled &#8220;<a href="http://mickeykay.me/2016/03/model-for-new-wordpress-plugin-directory/" target="_blank">A model for the new WordPress plugin directory</a>,&#8221; Kay identifies some of the common pain points that developers experience with the existing directory: &#8220;dependency on SVN instead of Git, inconsistent search results, inclusion of obsolete information, obfuscation of more important statistics, etc.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kay built WP Dev Dashboard to assist those who are trying to manage numerous extensions on WordPress.org, a process that currently requires drilling down into each plugin/theme to view data and support requests.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If I had to sum up the main problem I&#8217;m trying to solve, it&#8217;d be something like this: As a developer, and now maintainer of 16 plugins, it&#8217;s become all too easy for me to lose track of support requests, outdated core WP compatibility, and last updated dates,&#8221; Kay said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The current directory requires developers to manually click through to each plugin via their &#8220;<a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/mcguive7/#content-plugins" target="_blank">dashboard</a>&#8221; to check these stats. Plus, there are no options for notifications and/or other helpful automated features that would make my life much simpler.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When he first released the plugin, he planned to launch a free, hosted service that could automatically send out regular notifications for things like unresolved tickets and daily/weekly/monthly download counts. The hosted service would provide a centralized command center for managing WordPress.org-hosted extensions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t built anything yet as there&#8217;s so much talk about building out a better solution natively within WordPress.org,&#8221; Kay said. &#8220;My strong preference would be for the new plugin directory efforts to incorporate ideas like these to create a better, more seamless experience for both end users and developers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One of the items on the roadmap for the second milestone is the creation of a &#8220;<a href="https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1571" target="_blank">Plugin Author Admin</a>.&#8221; Kay hopes that his implementation could serve as an inspiration for what WordPress.org could provide for developers with the existing Plugin API.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The base functionality is already there as part of WordPress core, and all of the data is readily available via the existing Plugin API,&#8221; Kay said. &#8220;I think plugin authors stand to gain a ton from an updated admin/dashboard experience, and with 40,000+ plugins and counting, that’s a lot of happy points.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 29 Mar 2016 21:10:22 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"WPTavern: WordPress Contributor Rian Rietveld Wins Heroes of Accessibility Award";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52962";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:90:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-contributor-rian-rietveld-wins-heroes-of-accessibility-award";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2407:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rian.jpg"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rian.jpg?resize=760%2C382" alt="rian" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52968" /></a></p>\n<p>The 31st Annual <a href="http://www.csun.edu/cod/conference/2016/sessions/" target="_blank">International Technology and Persons with Disabilities Conference</a> was held in San Diego, California, last week.

With 20,000+ active installs and more than 260,000 downloads, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gigpress/" target="_blank">GigPress</a> is one of the most widely used plugins for musicians and performers who want to manage events with WordPress.</p>\n<p>Despite the plugin&#8217;s solid placement in the WordPress events niche, GigPress creator Derek Hogue is passing the keys over to Modern Tribe as an alternative to letting it &#8220;slowly die of neglect.&#8221; In his <a href="http://gigpress.com/blog/2016/03/gigpress-joins-modern-tribe/" target="_blank">acquisition announcement</a>, Hogue said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Eventually I started using other CMS’ more often than not, so my passion and impetus for improving GigPress fell off a cliff.</p>\n<p>For several years I kept GigPress alive via mostly bug fixes and compatibility updates. Last year I finally decided that the best hope for bringing my baby from its extended adolescence into adulthood would be to find it a new home.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hogue assured users that GigPress will continue to be a free, open-source plugin but with better support and a brighter future. He confessed that he was not able to sufficiently monetize the plugin to make it worth his time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can give away your plugin for free all day long, but as soon as you hit a certain scale, support becomes a burden,&#8221; Hogue said. &#8220;Creating revenue from plugins in WordPress takes an infrastructure which is prohibitive for many small developers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Modern Tribe, however, has fresh plans for GigPress and has already added some compatibilities for its <a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/product/wordpress-events-calendar/" target="_blank">Events Calendar</a> and <a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/product/wordpress-event-tickets-plus/" target="_blank">Event Tickets Plus</a> plugins.</p>\n<p>&#8220;GigPress has a big foothold in a really important vertical and a strong user base,&#8221; said Modern Tribe CEO Shane Pearlman. &#8220;One of our former team members made the introduction a few months back and exploring it together, the team was excited.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pearlman and his team see GigPress as a key addition to their suite of event management plugins but are still considering different paths for monetizing it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re definitely going to start serving specific verticals, with live music and touring artists being one of those,&#8221; Pearlman said. &#8220;Whether that’s directly through the evolution of the GigPress product, or introduction of complementary products is still in planing. Our first step is to gracefully integrate our <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/event-tickets/" target="_blank">Event Tickets</a> plugin so that bands and venues can sell tickets through the WP commerce platform of choice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pearlman said that as one of the principal players in the events management space, Modern Tribe plans to go beyond calendars and tickets. The team is looking into a SaaS model for its growing suite of event management plugins.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are actively exploring the nuances of a SaaS solution,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have an internal business plan showdown in progress and another strategic acquisition conversation in play.&#8221; Pearlman would not elaborate on the company&#8217;s next acquisition.</p>\n<p>The good news for those using GigPress is that Modern Tribe plans to build a profitable business on it, which will help to fund the support and future development of the open source plugin. If you&#8217;ve been waiting for help and updates in the past, chances are the experience of using GigPress will soon be greatly improved.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 28 Mar 2016 23:29:51 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"WPTavern: HeroPress Publishes Essays From 18 Countries in its First Year";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52918";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:82:"http://wptavern.com/heropress-publishes-essays-from-18-countries-in-its-first-year";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3247:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/heropress.jpg"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/heropress.jpg?resize=956%2C423" alt="heropress" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37733" /></a><br />\n<a href="http://heropress.com/">HeroPress.com, </a>where inspirational essays are published each week from people across the world is one year old.

Without understanding the best practice of creating a child theme, users resort to cramming all changes into the active theme. This puts them in a vulnerable position when security updates are available but they cannot update without overwriting their changes.</p>\n<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mgibbs189" target="_blank">Matt Gibbs</a>, lead developer of <a href="https://facetwp.com/" target="_blank">FacetWP</a>, has created a little project to help users with creating child themes. &#8220;<a href="https://github.com/FacetWP/use-child-theme" target="_blank">Use Child Theme</a>&#8221; is a simple drop-in PHP class that theme developers can use to alert their users to activate a child theme and automatically create one for them.</p>\n<div class="embed-wrap"></div>\n<p>&#8220;Normally, themes have to point users to a child theme documentation page or link to a pre-built child theme zip,&#8221; Gibbs said. &#8220;Most users don&#8217;t even bother.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gibbs said the Use Child Theme project was built to make it easy for theme authors to support it. The project was also an offshoot of his experiences supporting FacetWP.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I do a lot of plugin support, and this issue keeps coming up over and over,&#8221; Gibbs said. &#8220;Users are on super old theme versions and they&#8217;re afraid to upgrade because they&#8217;ve modified the parent theme at one point, and don&#8217;t want to lose changes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The idea behind <a href="https://github.com/FacetWP/use-child-theme" target="_blank">Use Child Theme</a> is to automatically create a child theme for someone who otherwise might not know how to create one. It&#8217;s not a plugin but rather a tool that theme developers can opt to include with just one line in functions.php:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate">include( dirname( __FILE__ ) . ''/use-child-theme.php'' );</pre>\n<p>WordPress theme developers, is this a method you would consider using to prompt users to activate a child theme? Or would you rather rely on links to documentation and/or a download link to a pre-built child theme?</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 28 Mar 2016 21:27:41 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:52:"WPTavern: Take the Mental Health in Tech 2016 Survey";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52889";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"http://wptavern.com/take-the-mental-health-in-tech-2016-survey";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2517:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/mental-health-in-tech-2016.png"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/mental-health-in-tech-2016.png?resize=1025%2C528" alt="mental-health-in-tech-2016" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52893" /></a></p>\n<p>Ed Finkler is on a mission to raise mental health awareness in the tech community with his <a href="https://osmihelp.org/" target="_blank">Open Source Mental Illness</a> (OSMI) campaign. In 2013 Finkler started speaking at conferences and gathering information on mental health in the tech workplace. His goal is to provide resources and documentation that companies can use to create more supportive environments for those dealing with mental health disorders.</p>\n<p>As part of the organization&#8217;s ongoing research, Finkler and the team at OSMI have authored <a href="https://cojfunkatroncom.typeform.com/to/Ao6BTw" target="_blank">a survey open to anyone working in the IT/tech community</a>. Respondents are not required to have a mental health issue in order to participate. The responses are recorded as anonymous and the survey does not collect any personal information.</p>\n<p>The bulk of the questions in the 10-minute survey gather information about employee&#8217;s perceptions of their co-workers and employer&#8217;s stance on dealing with mental health issues in the workplace. It asks if employers provide education on mental health topics, if there would be negative consequences of discussing these disorders in the workplace, and what kinds of benefits employers offer for treating mental health issues.</p>\n<p>After the survey concludes, OSMI will release the stats and information collected under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license</a>.</p>\n<p>Finkler, who has suffered from depression, anxiety, and ADHD, is working to combat the associated shame and stigma by speaking openly about mental illness at tech conferences, including Open Source Bridge, Connect-JS, and Laracon US.

Different combinations can produce wildly different designs. What if you could save a preview of customizations before going live with it? This is the idea behind the new <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/customize-snapshots/" target="_blank">Customize Snapshots</a> plugin from Weston Ruter, Derek Herman, and the team at <a href="https://xwp.co/" target="_blank">XWP</a>.</p>\n<p>Customize Snapshots lets you draft and preview customizer states that can be shared via a private URL that the plugin generates. Users who are not authenticated can preview snapshots on the frontend without loading the customizer. Authenticated users will be able to load the snapshot inside the customizer to make further edits or publish the draft.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/customize-snapshot.gif"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/customize-snapshot.gif?resize=1025%2C525" alt="customize-snapshot" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52864" /></a></p>\n<p>You may not be able to see it in the demo above, but snapshots can be saved with a scope of full or dirty, according to the plugin details page:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Full:</strong> will playback all the settings during preview [changeset]</li>\n<li><strong>Dirty:</strong> will only playback the ones that were marked dirty when the snapshot was taken [snapshot]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;Snapshots was written as a feature plugin to implement a key feature that the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/01/26/customizer-transactions-proposal/" target="_blank">Customizer Transactions proposal</a> will make possible,&#8221; Weston Ruter said. Ruter is the Technology Director at XWP and a co-maintainer of WordPress&#8217; core customizer component. He said the plugin was also developed specifically for a client&#8217;s project requirements.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Customize Snapshots stores the Customizer state in a custom post type,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can access the frontend of the site with the UUID for the snapshot added as a URL parameter to load the site with that Customizer state applied. So this makes it possible to preview Customizer changes on other devices entirely.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Coming Soon: Schedule Customizier Changes to Go Live at a Future Date</h3>\n<p>WordPress core lacks the ability to schedule out changes to content that has already been published. The only option for editing published posts is to push changes live. This is also the same for the customizer, but the XWP team is aiming to add scheduling to Customize Snapshots.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The idea here, though not implemented yet in the feature plugin, is that you could also schedule a snapshot (aka transaction) to go live at a certain time,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;So you could bundle up a bunch of changes in the Customizer and &#8216;Save &amp; Publish&#8217; at a scheduled time, like Sunday at midnight.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With transactions added to the customizer, users could build up a large &#8216;changeset&#8217; as a draft, including things like building new pages, adding a collection of widgets, and updating menu items. The entire set of changes can then be scheduled to go live at the same time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On the other side of that coin, it allows for there to be revision history for changes made in the Customizer,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;And this will work seamlessly with the <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts" target="_blank">Customize Posts</a> feature plugin &#8211; the goal being to let the author do as much as possible during a Customizer session, for all changes to be previewed together, submitted for review and iteration, and staged for publishing at some point in time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ruter said he sees Customize Snapshots as another take on the common desire to build out content on a staging environment, preview changes, and then promote those changes to production.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a hard problem to solve, and lots of plugins are available with solutions, like WP-CFM, Ramp, and others,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But in the Customizer it&#8217;s something you can get for free because of its model, and you don&#8217;t need multiple environments. You just need to indicate which snapshot/transaction state you want to preview.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you previously had a difficult time grasping the technical details of Ruter&#8217;s <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/01/26/customizer-transactions-proposal/" target="_blank">customizer transactions proposal</a>, the Customize Snapshots plugin is a perfect example of the kind of functionality that transactions would enable. The feature plugin is an adaptation of his proposed changes that implement the more fundamental “transactions” construct.</p>\n<p>Customize Snapshots adds to <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/xwp/#content-plugins" target="_blank">XWP&#8217;s collection of plugins</a> that extend the customizer in innovative ways and intersect with <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/23/outlining-a-possible-roadmap-for-the-customizer/" target="_blank">the framework&#8217;s long-term roadmap</a>. Occasionally, this will also tie into client work, as with the case of Customize Snapshots.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We try to propose Customizer solutions for client projects as a way to fund Customizer advances, but we also believe in the Customizer and would be working on it regardless,&#8221; Ruter said.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/customize-snapshots/" target="_blank">Customize Snapshots</a> makes the customizer a more collaborative environment within WordPress. If you need to make a large number of changes and share a preview with others, this plugin will help you do that. The ability to see snapshots in the admin and schedule changes will make it even more useful in the future.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 25 Mar 2016 20:52:53 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"WPTavern: Get Your Widgets Ready for WordPress 4.5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52812";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"http://wptavern.com/get-your-widgets-ready-for-wordpress-4-5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2255:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/testing.jpg"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/testing.jpg?resize=960%2C474" alt="testing" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46092" /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress 4.5 is right around the corner with the <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/03/wordpress-4-5-release-candidate/" target="_blank">first release candidate</a> now available for download.

Plugin and theme authors who want to be on the cutting edge of the customizer&#8217;s new capabilities will want to review Weston Ruter&#8217;s post on <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/03/22/implementing-selective-refresh-support-for-widgets/" target="_blank">Implementing Selective Refresh Support for Widgets</a>. All of the default WordPress themes and core widgets will ship with selective refresh in 4.5, but the feature is opt-in for plugins and themes.</p>\n<p>For most themes with standard sidebars, adding selective refresh is as simple as including one line to declare theme support:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate">add_theme_support( ''customize-selective-refresh-widgets'' );</pre>\n<p>Adding support for widgets is a bit more involved, depending on whether the widget uses JavaScript for initialization. Ruter&#8217;s post includes a tutorial for how to add selective refresh in either scenario. The <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/version-4-5-project-schedule/" target="_blank">target release date for 4.5</a> is April 12, 2016, so plugin and theme developers still have three weeks to add support.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 25 Mar 2016 16:18:43 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"WPTavern: Versions of WP-CLI Prior to 0.23.0 Are Incompatible with WordPress 4.5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52830";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:90:"http://wptavern.com/versions-of-wp-cli-prior-to-0-23-0-are-incompatible-with-wordpress-4-5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1873:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/restful-wp-cli.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49286" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/restful-wp-cli.png?resize=1025%2C459" alt="restful-wp-cli" /></a>Daniel Bachhuber, maintainer of <a href="http://wp-cli.org/">WP-CLI</a>, a popular command line interface utility for managing WordPress sites, <a href="http://wp-cli.org/blog/version-0.23.0.html">has released</a> version 0.23.0.

Since WordPress itself is already a magnet for spam signups and comments, BuddyPress is subject to the same and then some. With an ordinary WordPress site you can block most of it fairly well, but with BuddyPress you often have to wade through signups to verify that real humans aren&#8217;t getting blocked.</p>\n<p>One of the best ways to cut down on the avalanche of unwanted signups is to restrict them by email domain. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-rsed/" target="_blank">BP Restrict Signup by Email Domain</a> is a plugin that allows you to whitelist an email domain or set of domains that will be required for registration on the site. You can also set an error message and create a custom message to appear on the registration page.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/email-address-restrictions.png"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/email-address-restrictions.png?resize=566%2C862" alt="email-address-restrictions" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52791" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin was created by BuddyPress contributing developer Ray Hoh for the <a href="http://commons.gc.cuny.edu/" target="_blank">CUNY Academic Commons</a>. It&#8217;s part of a suite of plugins recommended by the <a href="http://commonsinabox.org/" target="_blank">Commons In A Box (CBOX)</a> free software project. The university uses the plugin to ensure that anyone signing up to the Academic Commons will have a CUNY email address. You can see it in action on the <a href="http://commons.gc.cuny.edu/register/" target="_blank">registration page</a>.</p>\n<p>BP Restrict Signup by Email Domain works on both single site and multisite installations of WordPress. It has been tested with the latest version of BuddyPress (2.5) but should also be compatible back to version 1.6.</p>\n<p>Not every social site can afford to limit email domains, but this plugin works well for academic sites, nonprofit or other types of organizations, or any community that excludes all but a few set email domains. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-rsed/" target="_blank">BP Restrict Signup by Email Domain</a> is open source on WordPress.org and is actively maintained for use on CUNY.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 23:09:28 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"WPTavern: Frederick Townes Confirms W3 Total Cache is Not Abandoned";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52766";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"http://wptavern.com/frederick-townes-confirms-w3-total-cache-is-not-abandoned";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7219:"<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/">W3 Total Cache</a> is a free, caching WordPress plugin created by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/fredericktownes/">Frederick Townes</a> that&#8217;s active on more than one million sites.

Out of 44 reports, 34 people say W3 Total Cache 0.9.4.1 doesn&#8217;t work with WordPress 4.4.2.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/W3TCBroken.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-52769" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/W3TCBroken.png?resize=884%2C626" alt="W3 Total Cache Not Compatible With WordPress 4.4.2" /></a>W3 Total Cache Not Compatible With WordPress 4.4.2\n<p>The plugin was recently updated with the <a href="https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/1375883/w3-total-cache">only change</a> being the readme.txt file which states it has been tested up to WordPress 4.5. A cursory glance at the support forums indicates <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-come-the-version-0941-now-says-updated-on-mar-21">some users</a> are <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/compatible-up-to-45-but-no-update-since-9-months-ago">not pleased</a> with the simple update.</p>\n<h2>A Rocky Year</h2>\n<p>In 2015, a disgruntled customer who purchased services from <a href="http://www.w3-edge.com/">W3 Edge</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/2r7un1/my_experience_with_what_its_like_with_w3_total/">described their negative experience</a> in a post on the WordPress subreddit. The complaints include, a lack of communication, not receiving purchased services, and project delays. Mike McAlister, of <a href="https://arraythemes.com/">Array Themes</a>, told the Tavern about his experience with W3 Edge.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In 2014, I signed up for the premium version of W3 Total Cache to unlock some of the advanced caching features. The email confirmation said that the license would auto-renew unless cancelled, so I contacted them right away with my request to cancel the auto-renewal. I didn&#8217;t hear anything back and wrongly assumed this was taken care of.</p>\n<p>Fast forward one year and I get an email out of nowhere that my W3 license had been renewed. I immediately contacted W3 with details of my order and politely requested a solution, but never heard a response.</p>\n<p>I wrote a total of four emails and several tweets directed at W3 Edge and its founder, Frederick Townes, with not a single response throughout the ordeal. Like many others, I had to resort to calling the bank and filing a dispute to get my money back, which dragged the issue out for several months.</p></blockquote>\n<p>At the end of the Reddit thread, W3 Edge <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/2r7un1/my_experience_with_what_its_like_with_w3_total/cqag9sw">responded to the criticism</a> and admitted that the company let users down with its lack of engagement. It also admitted to having a small team and the challenges involved with its support model.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the largest lessons learned is that there&#8217;s a lot to get right especially with a small team,&#8221; W3 Edge said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve made some changes to the team recently and we&#8217;re working to rectify experiences like the ones noted here. Since it’s the customer experience that matters and not intentions, I apologize for the negative experiences. Our mission remains to enable independent publishers with great software and solutions.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>W3 Total Cache Status Update</h2>\n<p>The company&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/w3edge/with_replies?lang=en">official Twitter account</a> has been inactive since April of 2015 and the <a href="https://www.w3-edge.com/weblog/">last post published</a> on its blog was 10 months ago. Combined with the lack of plugin updates, it&#8217;s understandable why customers and users are concerned with the plugin&#8217;s status.</p>\n<p>Frederick Townes, founder of W3 Edge, issued the following statement to the Tavern.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Since the last update, development and other operations have been ongoing. There have been several hundred bug fixes based on user feedback, more than 100 improvements and numerous major improvements. We’ve added tens of thousands of unit tests for the various bugs and improvements in an attempt to allow us to release more updates faster in the future.</p>\n<p>We’re also working on a new services and support model, which is more exclusive in an attempt to reduce the volume of service requests and misaligned customer / subscriber expectations.</p>\n<p>Our goal is unchanged, to create easy ways for publishers and developers to increase WordPress performance and tune user-experience in self-hosted environments. As we work towards leaving beta and moving towards a 1.0 release (and making our GitHub repository public rather than private) our goal is to offer hosted services that use automation to simplify the performance optimization process in the future.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I spoke to Townes for an hour on Skype and he comes across as a sincere, concerned business owner who is struggling to find a system that works for the amount of support volume he and his team are dealing with. I asked what keeps him motivated to continue working on W3 Total Cache, &#8220;I love solving complex problems which is what W3 Total Cache does,&#8221; Townes replied.</p>\n<p>I can only imagine how heavy the burdens are maintaining a free plugin that&#8217;s active on more than a million sites. Joost de Valk, founder of <a href="https://yoast.com/">Yoast.com</a>, and lead developer of <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/">WordPress SEO</a>, a plugin active on more than one million sites shared some of the <a href="https://yoast.com/yoast-seo-3-0-release-a-recap/">lessons he learned</a> after users experienced issues upgrading to 3.0.</p>\n<h2>Have The Changes Worked?</h2>\n<p>While researching for this article, I requested feedback from thousands of people to learn what recent customers are experiencing with the company but no one responded. This can mean any number of things but it&#8217;s difficult to determine whether the changes mentioned in the Reddit thread have improved the situation without getting feedback from recent customers.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve recently purchased services from W3 Edge, please share your experience with us in the comments.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 20:42:57 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"WPTavern: GitHub Issue and Pull Request Templates: Choose Your Own Adventure";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52746";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"http://wptavern.com/github-issue-and-pull-request-templates-choose-your-own-adventure";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2633:"<p>Last month GitHub <a href="http://wptavern.com/github-introduces-issue-and-pull-request-templates" target="_blank">introduced issue and pull request templates</a> in response to the <a href="http://wptavern.com/open-source-project-maintainers-confront-github-with-open-letter-on-issue-management" target="_blank">&#8220;Dear GitHub&#8221; letter of complaints</a> from open source project maintainers.

At every step you make selections that will help structure the final templates.

Is it user friendly? About as friendly as a mad hatter. Does the writing make sense? Absolutely not. Did I get it from idea to shipping in 3 days?

In addition to ironing out the logistics, contributors must also take into account what might be lost or gained in the GitHub approach to problem solving. The GitHub pull request collaboration style is markedly different than the lengthy discussions that happen on WordPress Trac.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, WordPress contributors who use GitHub as part of daily life are eager to see progress on an official pipeline for pull requests. In the meantime, Ryan McCue has just launched a utility that allows contributors to submit pull requests to core. <a href="https://rmccue.io/patch/" target="_blank">GitHub-to-Patch</a> is a proof-of-concept that provides an easy way to submit a pull request as a patch.</p>\n<p>The process that McCue outlines in his <a href="http://journal.rmccue.io/367/patch-wordpress-via-github/" target="_blank">post</a> involves submitting a pull request to the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress" target="_blank">WordPress/WordPress repo</a>, selecting the request via the utility, and associating the request with the corresponding ticket number. He also advises heading back to the ticket to leave a comment about the patch you added.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/github-to-patch-step-1.png"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/github-to-patch-step-1.png?resize=1025%2C703" alt="github-to-patch-step-1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52726" /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Internally, the utility uses GitHub’s API to get a patch format of the pull request, then uses Trac’s XML-RPC API to upload,&#8221; McCue said. &#8220;This requires your WordPress.org credentials, and because of cross-origin policy, also requires an intermediary server. I hope to fix this in the future, either by integrating the tool into Trac itself, or by using OAuth with WordPress.org.&#8221;</p>\n<p>McCue clarified on Twitter that his utility is not meant to be a final solution to WordPress/GitHub interactions but rather a stop-gap measure until a better solution is available. He <a href="https://twitter.com/rmccue/status/712143679780200448" target="_blank">referenced</a> Weston Ruter&#8217;s approach that <a href="https://make.xwp.co/2015/12/05/streamlining-contributions-to-wordpress-core-via-github/" target="_blank">uses Travis CI to handle uploading patches from trusted pull requests to Trac</a> as one of the more elegant examples in the works.</p>\n<p>For those with no SVN experience, GitHub-to-Patch significantly lowers the barrier to entry for contributing to core. If you don&#8217;t want to use the <a href="https://rmccue.io/patch/" target="_blank">utility</a> on McCue&#8217;s server, the code is available on GitHub and can be installed on your own server.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 18:34:38 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"WPTavern: WordPress Adopts Accessibility Coding Standards for All New and Updated Code";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52690";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:96:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-adopts-accessibility-coding-standards-for-all-new-and-updated-code";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3221:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/paper-1.jpg"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/paper-1.jpg?resize=960%2C501" alt="photo credit: Startup Stock Photos" class="size-full wp-image-52706" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://stocksnap.io/photo/L2KBJB91D6">Startup Stock Photos</a>\n<p>The Accessibility Team announced today that the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/accessibility-coding-standards/" target="_blank">WordPress Accessibility Coding Standards</a> have been approved for the core handbook. The team <a href="http://wptavern.com/your-chance-to-give-feedback-on-wordpress-accessibility-coding-standards" target="_blank">sought feedback on the draft of the guidelines</a> earlier this year and, after a few revisions, the coding standards are out of draft status.</p>\n<p>Contributors will now be required to meet these guidelines in order to have their code merged into core:</p>\n<blockquote><p>All new or updated code released in WordPress must conform with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag" target="_blank">WCAG 2.0 guidelines</a> at level AA.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Level AA, according to accessibility team member Rian Rietveld, includes guidelines used as a reference for a legal standard in many countries. WordPress&#8217; new accessibility coding standards cover five key areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HTML Semantics</li>\n<li>Color Contrast</li>\n<li>Keyboard Accessibility</li>\n<li>Images and Icons</li>\n<li>Labeling</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The default Twenty Sixteen theme is already compliant with WCAG 2 AA and more <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/accessibility-ready/" target="_blank">accessibility-ready themes</a> are tagged in the official directory. At this time, themes and plugins hosted on WordPress.org are not required to meet these guidelines.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Having a dedicated principle that WordPress needs to meet a certain level of accessibility standards is incredibly powerful,&#8221; contributor Joe Dolson said in a reaction on his <a href="https://www.joedolson.com/2016/03/wordpress-goes-wcag-mean/" target="_blank">blog</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since it doesn’t change the fact that the WordPress Accessibility team consists of a relatively small group of part-time volunteers, we have to realistically acknowledge that we won’t catch everything.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But that still leaves us with an overall arc that leads to a future with a more accessible WordPress, and that’s an unmistakable win for accessibility,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Vocal accessibility advocates have been <a href="http://wptavern.com/your-chance-to-give-feedback-on-wordpress-accessibility-coding-standards" target="_blank">calling for WordPress to adopt a set of standards</a> and these new guidelines demonstrate the project&#8217;s commitment to serving those with a disability.

The security measure will help combat increasing attempts on the host&#8217;s user portal.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As we grow, almost everything about the company changes, and security is one of them,&#8221; said WP Engine founder Jason Cohen. &#8220;For example, we see things like fraudulent accounts and account impersonation/phishing, and other things which didn’t appear often when we were smaller and less of a target.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Adding 2FA is part of a larger plan for improved security that the company began last year when it hired Eric Murphy as its new security director.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’ve had a cross-departmental internal security group of about a dozen people for a few years now, but in 2015 we decided we needed even more leadership in that area,&#8221; Cohen said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We hired Eric last year, in fact before the December security incident, so in hindsight that was excellent timing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Murphy is now overseeing the technical aspects of security, like firewalls and VPNs, as well as the social engineering and training aimed at protecting customer account access.</p>\n<p>After the December breach where <a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-engine-security-breach-customer-credentials-exposed" target="_blank">customer credentials were exposed</a>, WP Engine began moving its customers off of Linode&#8217;s cloud infrastructure. Cohen confirmed that thousands of customers have been moved and that no new customers have been added to Linode.</p>\n<h3>The Challenges of Implementing 2FA</h3>\n<p>Although providing 2FA for accounts is a security best practice, Cohen said that it would not have prevented the December breach, as the entry point was with Linode. Regardless, WP Engine customers have been requesting 2FA support for the user portal for years. When asked why it took the company so long to implement it, Cohen identified a few of the technical challenges.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the challenges was in identity recovery,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We can’t use email as a way to recover from a lost phone, because then the email address becomes a &#8216;single factor,&#8217; i.e. you can use it to recover your password as well as your phone aspect.</p>\n<p>&#8220;However, nowadays with the advent of Google Authenticator and other apps, plus people’s general awareness of how to use things like scratch codes, we felt it was now not going to be hard for people to use,&#8221; Cohen said.</p>\n<p>When it comes to protecting WordPress, WP Engine customers have always been able to use a plugin to add 2FA. Cohen said that the company is investigating a solution to make it more convenient for customers who manage multiple accounts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Suppose you manage 50 WP sites and you want 2FA,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So do you configure 2FA on every site and have 50 entries in your Google Authenticator App? That stinks!</p>\n<p>&#8220;So, something better would be a SSO system somewhere, have 2FA on <em>that</em>, and then use that to get into WordPress,&#8221; Cohen said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Another way would be to use OAuth, e.g. use Google OAuth on WP, and indeed for customers who already use Google Apps, we do recommend that method. Another method might be that our own User Portal be an OAuth provider.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With a host of solutions already available, Cohen said they are also considering simply pointing customers to a list of recommendations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even if we do our own, we’d always support the other methods,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The idea isn’t to box anyone into a single method.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WP Engine Plans to Add Opt-In PHP 7 Support in 2016</h3>\n<p>WP Engine is currently <a href="https://wpengine.com/blog/php-7-the-way-of-the-future/" target="_blank">working on a PHP 7 implementation</a> for all customers. In December, the company tested 25 concurrent users over 5 minutes across 10 randomly selected URLs — run against a basic WordPress (4.3.1) install on its Mercury Vagrant configuration. The results showed that PHP 7 handles the raw hits 2.6x faster than PHP 5.5.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/wp-engine-testing.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52674" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/wp-engine-testing.png?resize=1025%2C709" alt="wp-engine-testing" /></a></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, customers who are eager to see WP Engine upgrade to PHP 7 across the board will be waiting for the rest of the WordPress ecosystem to catch up. As an alternative, the company is looking at the possibility of making PHP 7 an opt-in.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have PHP7 running on some machines,&#8221; Cohen said. &#8220;But it’s actually amazing how few WP sites in the field are compatible. We’re finding that it&#8217;s less than 20%. There will need to be an opt-in for that reason.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although WordPress core is compatible with PHP 7, the vast majority of WordPress plugins and themes are not.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even WooCommerce doesn’t completely work with it,&#8221; Cohen said. &#8220;Many big, popular plugins are not yet compatible. With PHP v5.5 there was some of that, but this is much more. Of course PHP7 is the future so it’s inevitable, but it’s going to take more time than some other PHP releases did.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cohen said the best case scenario would be for customers to choose PHP 7 on an install-by-install basis and change at any time.

This post is an assortment of items related to WordPress that caught my eye but didn&#8217;t make it into a full post.</p>\n<h2>Human Made Hires Siobhan McKeown</h2>\n<p>Development firm, Human Made Ltd., <a href="https://hmn.md/2016/03/17/siobhan-mckeown-joins-human-made/">announced</a> that it has hired Siobhan McKeown as their events director. Human Made worked closely with McKeown who helped organize and run <a href="https://feelingrestful.com">A Day of REST</a>, a conference devoted to the WordPress REST API. According to the post, McKeown&#8217;s role is to expand the company&#8217;s events, including the Day of Rest conference.</p>\n<h2>WordPress is the Light in a Sea of Darkness</h2>\n<p>Raghavendra Satish Peri from India, who discovered at the age of 14 that he was 80% blind, <a href="http://heropress.com/essays/finding-hope-darkness/">describes how WordPress</a> became a shining light in a sea of darkness.</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress has changed the way I see my life, today I am a full time <a href="http://www.digitala11y.com">Digital Accessibility Consultant</a> &amp; I build most of my code examples on WP. This is helping me grow professionally &amp; personally each day. I am financially independent, travel around the world, attend &amp; speak at conferences/meet-ups, fought depression with my writing, wrote a bucket list &amp; am actively pursuing it. All this would have not been possible with the power of publishing &amp; WP has simplified it for me.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the post, Satish Peri says he has two wishes. The first is to attend WordCamp US and meet Matt Mullenweg. The second is to see every part of WordPress core be accessible. While the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/">WordPress accessibility team</a> is working on his second wish, how can we as a community grant the first?</p>\n<h2>WordPress&#8217; Greatest Threat Isn&#8217;t a CMS</h2>\n<p>Chris Wallace explains why the <a href="http://chriswallace.org/the-biggest-threat-to-wordpress-isnt-another-cms/">greatest threat to WordPress</a> isn&#8217;t a competing CMS, but the people who criticize it in a rude and disrespectful way.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But the biggest threat to WordPress right now is not a CMS. Heck, it’s not even a technology challenge or an issue with legacy code. The biggest threat to WordPress is people in the community who voice opinions in a rude and disrespectful way, echoing a deep lack of appreciation for the contributors and project leaders simply trying to make WordPress better within the framework of being used on 25% of the web <em>with a desire to continue increasing that number</em>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I tried to explain <a href="http://wptavern.com/how-not-to-communicate-grievances-with-wordpress">how to be helpful</a> when criticizing WordPress last year, but I&#8217;m not sure I made an impact. I know from experience that encountering a constant barrage of criticism is unhealthy and can lead to burnout. The same holds true for those who are committed to improving WordPress on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not that things need to be sugarcoated, it&#8217;s that criticism should be given in an actionable way to make things better for all involved. It&#8217;s also about civil discourse and treating others with respect.</p>\n<p>The final part of Wallace&#8217;s post is great advice:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Let’s all take a few minutes to be grateful for the opportunity to make a living off the hard work of thousands of other people who donated their time and code to build something that has made a huge impact on the Internet and in people’s actual lives.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Matt Mullenweg on The Changelog Podcast</h2>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg appeared on <a href="https://changelog.com/197/">The Changelog podcast</a> to discuss the future of WordPress and how Calypso fits in. It&#8217;s a great show as the duo dive deep into the role JavaScript plays in the future of WordPress.</p>\n<h2>Developing a WordPress Plugin That Uses Service APIs</h2>\n<p>Smashing Magazine <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/03/making-a-wordpress-plugin-that-uses-service-apis/">published a great guide</a> that explains how to create a plugin that taps into third-party service APIs.</p>\n<h2>Adopting Plugins is Life Changing for Some</h2>\n<p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/meet-the-team/us/david-gewirtz/">David Gewirtz</a>, who writes for ZDNet, describes how <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/a-year-later-what-happens-when-you-adopt-an-open-source-project/">adopting 10 WordPress plugins changed his life</a>. It&#8217;s one of the coolest stories I&#8217;ve read on the use of the <a href="http://wptavern.com/adopt-me-plugin-tag-is-now-in-use-on-wordpress-org">&#8220;Adopt-Me&#8221; tag</a> in the WordPress plugin directory. One of the best parts of the story is when Gewirtz explains what happened when he adopted a plugin with more than 10K active installs.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Seamless Donations had more than 10,000 active users on the day I adopted it. I expected my workload would be roughly the same as for the widget. I&#8217;d make a few security fixes as they came along and tweaks for compatibility.</p>\n<p>I was wrong.</p>\n<p>I also expected the users to be seasoned webmasters. After all, if you&#8217;re installing an open source project on your server, you&#8217;re obviously going to be experienced with Linux and PHP and all the rest, right? Right?</p>\n<p>Oh, how wrong I was.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Definitely give this a read if you&#8217;re thinking about adopting a popular plugin.</p>\n<h2>Warm Weather Wapuu</h2>\n<p>As a traditional part of this series, I end each issue by featuring a Wapuu design. For those who don&#8217;t know, Wapuu is the <a href="http://wapuu.jp/2015/12/12/wapuu-origins/">unofficial mascot</a> of the WordPress project. Since the first day of Spring in the US is Sunday, March 20th, I decided to feature the Wapuu family from WordCamp Miami. Each member of the family except for the basketball one, is a reminder that warmer weather is on the way!</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The official <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcmia?src=hash">#wcmia</a> Wapuu family. <a href="http://t.co/U2Ao9Yh0qN">pic.twitter.com/U2Ao9Yh0qN</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; WordCamp Miami (@wordcampmiami) <a href="https://twitter.com/wordcampmiami/status/606179756472692736">June 3, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it for issue five.

James writes about marketing, digital design, entrepreneurship, and technology. He has gained most of his experience from running a variety of his own businesses for more than a decade.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>On January 12, 2016, the W3C (the World Wide Web Consortium) released its first public working draft of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-webmention-20160112/" target="_blank">Webmentions</a>, but the announcement didn’t feel new. In fact, Webmentions have been around since IndieWebCamp created them in 2013, and <a href="https://www.toptal.com/wordpress" target="_blank">top WordPress developers</a> are already using a Webmentions plugin to utilize the tool.</p>\n<p>Yet, for those who use WordPress, Webmentions seemed like a retread of WordPress’ Pingback system from the early 2000s, which featured a similar concept.</p>\n<p>The Pingback system was invented in 2002 by Stuart Langridge, and in essence, it allowed pieces that were published on different WordPress sites to talk to each other. This is perhaps best explained by walking through an example scenario:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Website A posts a new entry on its blog.</li>\n<li>Website B responds to that blog post with its own post and links to the post on Website A.</li>\n<li>The Pingback system then notifies Website A that Website B wrote about and linked to its blog post.</li>\n<li>Website A then verifies the content and link on Website B. If it is not spam, Website A will post a comment on the original blog post linking to Website B’s post.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It’s important to note a few things about the Pingback system. First, it is exclusively for WordPress sites, and both sites have to enable Pingback for it to work. Second, the whole Pingback system is automated, streamlining the process of trackbacks, which is the manual equivalent of the automated Pingback.</p>\n<p>Yet despite its perks, <a href="http://wptavern.com/its-time-for-xml-rpc-in-wordpress-to-hit-the-road" target="_blank">Pingback system usage</a> declined after the automatic system was taken advantage of by spammers.</p>\n<p>The issue of spamming and abuse of such a communication channel has long been the problem with this type of communication channel. Prior to Pingbacks, WordPress used a Trackback system that provided the same type of communication.</p>\n<p>The only difference between the Trackback system and Pingbacks is that Trackbacks had to be inputted manually. Spamming problems were just as prevalent with trackbacks. In fact the WPTavern site <a href="http://wptavern.com/wptavern-was-trackbacked-to-death" target="_blank">shut down in 2010</a> because of trackback spam.</p>\n<p>So what makes Webmentions different than the Pingbacks and Trackbacks that came before? Well, not all that much. Turns out, Webmentions do the exact same thing as the Pingback system; they just do it better.</p>\n<p>The biggest difference between the two is the code they’re composed of. Pingback uses XMLRPC, an outdated approach that encodes data with XML and then transports that data with HTTP. The Pingback system is bulky and slow. Webmentions, on the other hand, uses HTTP and x-www-form-urlencoded content, a much more widely accepted format in today’s world. The result is that Webmentions is much faster and much easier to integrate.</p>\n<p>As Pingback’s creator Langridge <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2014/11/29/enabling-webmentions/" target="_blank">points out on his blog</a>, “XMLRPC is considerably less popular than it was, and is really heavyweight for this sort of thing. We’ve learned since then that HTTP can actually do all this stuff for us way more simply.” If you haven’t guessed, the Pingback founder has converted to Webmentions too.</p>\n<p>Webmention’s growing popularity is due to the tool’s ease of use and the fact that it blocks spam effectively with the <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/Vouch" target="_blank">Vouch protocol</a>. But Webmentions also look better aesthetically in the comments section. Pingback comments look robotic and aren’t exactly readable; a Pingback comment contains the title of the post that sent the Pingback and an ellipsed summary that doesn’t make much sense.</p>\n<p>Webmentions look and feel like human comments with the help of the <a href="https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-semantic-linkbacks" target="_blank">Semantic Linkbacks plugin</a>. This plugin parses the Webmention linkback and translates it into a full sentence (e.g. ‘Sarah mentioned this post in her article x on site y’) and can even include the author’s profile picture.</p>\n<p>Webmentions are quickly replacing the Pingback system because of the tool’s convenience and better implementation to reach a similar goal, and this has been happening prior to W3C’s public endorsement. So what does W3C’s support of <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention" target="_blank">IndieWebCamp’s creation</a> mean?</p>\n<p>Ultimately, W3C’s announcement will likely help cement Webmention’s place on the internet. And so W3C’s recent push can be and should be considered as an effort to standardize the wild web.</p>\n<p>The internet was created to communicate and share information, yet individual pieces of content are unable to communicate with each other as easily as users can. The Pingback system was a worthy, but flawed, attempt to change that, and now Pingback’s legacy survives through the broader support and growing distribution of Webmention’s network. If Webmentions become more popular, maybe one day in the future, they will connect the strands of the web together, so that the web will have earned its namesake in truth.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 18 Mar 2016 17:40:57 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:107:"WPTavern: Cory Miller and Pippin Williamson Discuss the Importance of Mental Health on Office Hours Podcast";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52599";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:117:"http://wptavern.com/cory-miller-and-pippin-williamson-discuss-the-importance-of-mental-health-on-office-hours-podcast";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2006:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/heart.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-52604"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/heart.jpg?resize=1024%2C587" alt="photo credit: rubryan" class="size-full wp-image-52604" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rubyran2626/2263837091/in/faves-57854010@N05/">rubryan</a>\n<p>In the latest episode of <a href="http://officehours.fm/" target="_blank">Office Hours</a>, a WordPress business podcast, host Carrie Dils interviewed <a href="https://ithemes.com/" target="_blank">Cory Miller</a> and <a href="https://pippinsplugins.com/" target="_blank">Pippin Williamson</a> to discuss the importance of personal wellness.

I took the plugin for a test drive to see how easy it is to use.</p>\n<h2>A Great Introduction</h2>\n<p>Upon activation, a WPForms introduction screen is displayed. This screen provides information on how to create your first form and includes an embedded video explaining how. I had to watch the video a few times to follow along but overall it serves its purpose.</p>\n<p>If video is not your thing, consider walking through the <a href="https://wpforms.com/docs/creating-first-form/">step by step guide</a> on the WPForms website. Those who want to jump right in can do so by clicking the <strong>WPForms &gt; Add New</strong> link.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormsIntroductionScreen.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52581"><img class="size-full wp-image-52581" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormsIntroductionScreen.png?resize=1025%2C675" alt="WP Forms Introduction Screen" /></a>WPForms Introduction Screen\n<h2>WPForm User Interface Forces You to Focus</h2>\n<p>One of the first things I noticed is the user interface and how it appears over WordPress. It was shocking at first to see WordPress disappear but the team chose to use this interface to avoid being constrained with WordPress&#8217; user interface. After working with WPForms for more than an hour, I found myself enjoying the fact that the interface forced me to focus on creating my form.</p>\n<p>WPForms ships with six different templates to handle the most common use cases. All templates except the Blank Form and the Simple Contact form require you to upgrade to the commercial version. I chose the simple contact form template.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormTemplates.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52582"><img class="size-full wp-image-52582" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormTemplates.png?resize=1025%2C559" alt="WPForm Templates" /></a>WPForm Templates\n<p>The simple contact form template automatically adds a name, email, paragraph, and submit fields to the form. An important time saver that sets WPForms apart from other plugins is that, the fields are automatically flagged as required.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormSimpleContactFormTemplate.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52583"><img class="size-full wp-image-52583" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormSimpleContactFormTemplate.png?resize=1025%2C605" alt="WPForm Simple Contact Form Template" /></a>WPForm Simple Contact Form Template\n<p>You can rearrange the fields by clicking and dragging them up or down. Rearranging fields is a breeze, doesn&#8217;t require a page refresh, and doesn&#8217;t bog down the browser. When clicking on a field, its properties are displayed on the left where you can configure its label, format, description, and whether or not its required.</p>\n<p>Advanced options enable you to determine a field&#8217;s size, placeholder text, default values, and whether to hide the label or sub-labels. Switching between screens and configuring fields is a fast, straightforward process.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormFieldOptions.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52584"><img class="size-full wp-image-52584" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormFieldOptions.png?resize=1025%2C671" alt="WPForm Field Options" /></a>WPForm Field Options\n<p>Once the fields are configured, you&#8217;ll want to click the Settings screen. This is where you can configure what happens when a visitor clicks the submit button. You can enable or disable email notifications and use smart tags to configure the form&#8217;s output. This version of WPForms Lite doesn&#8217;t have email templates but Balkhi says it&#8217;s something the team is working on.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormSmartTags.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52585"><img class="size-full wp-image-52585" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormSmartTags.png?resize=1025%2C489" alt="WPForm Smart Tags" /></a>WPForm Smart Tags\n<p>Here is what the form&#8217;s output looks like in Thunderbird. Personally, I like Jetpack&#8217;s formatting style more but this could change once WPForms supports email templates.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormOutput.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52586"><img class="size-full wp-image-52586" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormOutput.png?resize=836%2C367" alt="WPForm Output" /></a>WPForms Output\n<p>As a comparison, this is what Jetpack&#8217;s Contact Form module output looks like in Thunderbird. The text looks better and I appreciate the bold field names.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/JetpacksFormOutput.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52588"><img class="size-full wp-image-52588" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/JetpacksFormOutput.png?resize=809%2C310" alt="Jetpack Contact Form Output" /></a>Jetpack Contact Form Module Output\n<p>WPForms battles spam using two different methods, honeypot and <a href="https://wpforms.com/docs/setup-captcha-wpforms/">reCAPTCHA.</a> reCAPTCHA is a free,  <a href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html">anti-spam service</a> provided by Google. In order to use it with WPForms, you&#8217;ll need to sign up for an account and add your site key and secret key to WPForm&#8217;s settings page.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormsSettingsPage.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52590"><img class="size-full wp-image-52590" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormsSettingsPage.png?resize=1025%2C420" alt="WPForms Settings Page" /></a>WPForms Settings Page\n<p>Once a form is configured and saved, adding it to a page is easy. Simply create a new page in WordPress and in the editor, click the Add Form button. A modal will pop up giving you the option to choose which form to add to the page. You can also choose whether to show the form&#8217;s title and description from this box. When a form is added to the page, WPForms puts a shortcode like [ wpforms id=&#8221;50582&#8243; ] into the content area.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormInsertUI.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52592"><img class="size-full wp-image-52592" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormInsertUI.png?resize=498%2C219" alt="UI For Inserting a WPForm into a Page" /></a>UI For Inserting a WPForm into a Page\n<p>I configured WPForms to not apply styling to my form. However, you can choose whether WPForms applies base and form theme styling or base styling only. You&#8217;ll want to experiment with these options to see if your form looks any better with styles applied.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormsTavernContactForm.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52593"><img class="size-full wp-image-52593" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/WPFormsTavernContactForm.png?resize=696%2C881" alt="WPForms Contact Form on The Tavern Frontend" /></a>WPForms Contact Form on The Tavern Frontend\n<h2>My Verdict?</h2>\n<p>You should know that outside of creating simple contact forms and what&#8217;s available via the standard fields, almost everything else requires you to upgrade to the commercial version, including the ability to store and view form entries in WordPress. However, the plugin doesn&#8217;t nag or annoy you with popups that a commercial version is available. Upgrade prompts are only triggered when trying to access a commercial feature.</p>\n<p>After putting WPForms Lite through its paces, it&#8217;s definitely one of the easiest and fastest ways to set up a contact form. It&#8217;s clear by using the supplied templates that Balkhi and his team have considered common pitfalls and have done a great job eliminating them.</p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t looked into the contact form space in WordPress for a few years but after testing WPForms, I&#8217;m motivated to compare some of the most popular plugins in the space to see how each one tackles the user experience. Expect a detailed roundup in the next few weeks.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 18 Mar 2016 02:05:36 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:123:"WPTavern: Stack Overflow Survey Results Show WordPress is Trending Up, Despite Being Ranked Among Most Dreaded Technologies";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52540";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:132:"http://wptavern.com/stack-overflow-survey-results-show-wordpress-is-trending-up-despite-being-ranked-among-most-dreaded-technologies";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7217:"<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2016.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52554"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2016.png?resize=1025%2C462" alt="stack-overflow-developer-survey-2016" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52554" /></a></p>\n<p>Stack Overflow published the results of its <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016" target="_blank">2016 Developer Survey</a>, summarizing responses from 56,033 developers in 173 countries. The 45-question survey collected answers from more than twice as many developers as the previous year.</p>\n<p>The results were published along with a disclaimer recognizing that the survey is &#8220;biased against devs who don&#8217;t speak English, or who don&#8217;t like taking English-language surveys.&#8221; Nevertheless, since the survey captured responses from such a large number of developers on a site that receives 40 million visitors per month, the results are definitely worth a read.</p>\n<p>The average age of developers surveyed was 29.6 years old and 92.8% of the respondents were male. Most of them are at least partially self-taught (69%) with 45% of them having acquired degrees in computer science or a related field.</p>\n<p>A quick developer profile of those surveyed shows that the largest section (28%) is made up of those who identify as a full-stack web developer.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/developer-profile.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52557"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/developer-profile.png?resize=1025%2C490" alt="developer-profile" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52557" /></a></p>\n<h3>Developers Value Diversity</h3>\n<p>Despite the fact that the vast majority of the respondents were male, the results indicate that developers value diversity. In summarizing 42,156 responses, Stack Overflow found the following:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Overall, about 73% of developers tell us they think diversity is at least somewhat important in the workplace. 41% of developers say diversity is very important. And developers who most often influence hiring decisions are more likely to believe in the value of diversity than other developer types.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/diversity.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52544"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/diversity.png?resize=1025%2C481" alt="diversity" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52544" /></a></p>\n<h3>Visual Basic and WordPress Top the List for Most Dreaded Technologies</h3>\n<p>WordPress moved up one spot from last year in the ranking of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted" target="_blank">most dreaded technologies</a> that respondents would prefer not to use. This is not surprising given that the most popular tags for posts on Stack Overflow are JavaScript, Java, Android, and Python.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/most-dreaded.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52546"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/most-dreaded.png?resize=1025%2C634" alt="most-dreaded" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52546" /></a></p>\n<p>On the other hand, when surveying the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#most-popular-technologies-per-occupation" target="_blank">most popular technologies per developer type</a>, WordPress is currently used by 24.1% of front-end developers. As a side note, this also corresponds roughly to its current <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/content_management/all" target="_blank">market share</a> (26%).</p>\n<h3>WordPress and JavaScript Technologies Are Trending Up</h3>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/trending-technologies.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52548"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/trending-technologies.png?resize=1025%2C842" alt="trending-technologies" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52548" /></a></p>\n<p>Newer technologies like React, Node.js, and AngularJS are trending, with the above percentages representing the change in share of Stack Overflow votes between January 2015 and January 2016. All three are also among the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#technology-top-paying-tech" target="_blank">top-paying technologies</a> per occupation for both full stack and front-end developers.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that all of these trending technologies are also becoming more readily integrated with WordPress, and will be more widely used when the REST API is finally merged with core.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that WordPress ranks second in the most dreaded technology category, it is also trending up 18.5% from 2015. According to these results, WordPress&#8217; popularity is increasing at a rate similar to that of many JavaScript-based technologies.</p>\n<h3>Job Title and Remote Work Are Important Priorities for Experienced Developers</h3>\n<p>The 2016 results found that 91% of developers surveyed worldwide are “gainfully employed” (full-time, self-employed, or freelance). Developers are in high demand, with just 15% of respondents actively looking for a job. It&#8217;s also interesting to note that 78% of developers surveyed are interested in exploring new employment opportunities.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re trying to hire a developer, one of the most important things to consider is that they highly prioritize being able to work remotely. Responses from 49,521 developers indicate that as they gain more years of experience, both job title and remote work options are increasing priorities.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/priorities.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52549"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/priorities.png?resize=1025%2C675" alt="priorities" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52549" /></a></p>\n<p>Only 30% of developers currently work remotely part-time or full-time, but Stack Overflow found that remote developers are more likely to love their jobs than other developers. If you own a company that hires developers, chances are that you will attract a larger, more experienced pool of applicants if employees are allowed to work remotely.</p>\n<p>Developers who want to get a better understanding of the broader industry&#8217;s work challenges, salary expectations, and most popular technologies will want to review the full <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016" target="_blank">results of the survey</a>.</p>\n<p>The document includes some important feedback for the WordPress community to consider. Although WordPress is among the technologies that are trending up, the broader development community still does not seem to enjoy working with it. How can we make the software more developer-friendly without compromising user friendliness?</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 17 Mar 2016 21:57:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 226 – Burnout";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://wptavern.com?p=52552&preview_id=52552";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-226-burnout";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2888:"<p>In this episode of WordPress Weekly, <a href="http://marcuscouch.com/">Marcus Couch</a> and I discuss the symptoms of burnout and share tips on how to prevent it.

The FBI has requested that the company hack into an iPhone recovered from one of the terrorists involved in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_San_Bernardino_attack" target="_blank">San Bernardino mass shooting</a> to assist in the criminal investigation.</p>\n<p>Apple has refused numerous court orders to create a new tool that would allow the government to circumvent the iPhone&#8217;s security measures that protect the encrypted communications of private individuals. The company will go to court on March 22nd for hearing in Riverside, CA. Fight for the Future plans to display thousands of statements in support of Apple from Internet users outside the courthouse.</p>\n<p>The Save Security campaign website summarized what is at stake with the government forcing Apple to weaken its encryption:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In its attacks on Apple, the FBI is seeking a legal precedent that would let them force any company to weaken the security of its products. Engineers use consumer products like the iPhone to maintain the most sensitive systems on the planet. Hospitals. Air traffic control. Nuclear power. What the FBI is asking for puts lives at risk, by undermining security everywhere.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Two weeks ago, Automattic <a href="https://transparency.automattic.com/2016/03/03/automattic-and-wordpress-com-stand-with-apple-to-support-digital-security/" target="_blank">announced</a> that it stands with Apple to support digital security. The company <a href="https://cloudup.com/iZG9vzAV3U3" target="_blank">filed an amicus brief</a> in support of Apple alongside Cloudflare, Ebay, Kickstarter, Twitter, GitHub, Reddit, Square, and other leading technology companies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The fact is that if a security flaw exists, there is no way to ensure that only trusted governments, investigating a crime, can exploit that vulnerability,&#8221; Automattic&#8217;s attorney Paul Sieminski said in the announcement. &#8220;Improving security for everyone means aggressively finding and closing holes, not creating new ones.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you want to join in Fight for the Future&#8217;s campaign to support Apple, the <a href="https://savesecurity.org/" target="_blank">SaveSecurity.org</a> website offers a profile picture you can use as well as a website banner (see <a href="https://savesecurity.org/?ALWAYS_SHOW_SC_BANNER=true" target="_blank">live demo</a>) to raise awareness.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 16 Mar 2016 22:56:45 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"WPTavern: How to Connect Your WordPress Powered Site to Apple News Publisher";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52502";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"http://wptavern.com/how-to-connect-your-wordpress-powered-site-to-apple-news-publisher";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5623:"<p>When Apple News Publisher <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2015/06/08Apple-Announces-News-App-for-iPhone-iPad.html">launched in September, 2015</a>, it partnered with 20 publishers including, ESPN, The New York Times, and CNN.

Note, that in order to <a href="https://help.apple.com/newspublisher/icloud/#/apdd44eeeeeb">place ads</a> in your content, you need to publish articles from a CMS like WordPress.</p>\n<h2>Is News Publisher Worth the Hassle?</h2>\n<p>As a new publisher to Apple&#8217;s syndication system, it&#8217;s too early to tell if signing up was a waste of time or a benefit to readers.

It was designed to suit creative websites, with written content and photographs receiving equal treatment.</p>\n<p>The theme is actually a fork of <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/receptar/" target="_blank">Receptar</a>, a theme by <a href="http://www.webmandesign.eu/" target="_blank">WebMan Design</a>. The original split-screen, book-like design for single posts was created to look like a modern cook book.</p>\n<p>Automattic designers added a featured content slider to the homepage along with a sticky top navigation menu, among other changes. The featured tag can be set in the customizer. If you don&#8217;t want to use the slider, the theme will default to displaying the custom header image (which is set by adding a featured image to the page assigned as the static homepage).</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/dyad-screenshot.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52479"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/dyad-screenshot.png?resize=660%2C683" alt="dyad-screenshot" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52479" /></a></p>\n<p>The homepage sports a grid layout for posts with featured images and excerpts side-by-side. Single posts display the featured image and title at 50% of of the screen with the content on the other half. The layout responds nicely for mobile devices.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/dyad-single-post-responsive.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52495"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/dyad-single-post-responsive.png?resize=660%2C391" alt="dyad-single-post-responsive" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52495" /></a></p>\n<p>Dyad includes one expandable widget area in the footer. Any widgets dropped into this area will expand to fit one, two, three, or four columns. The footer also includes space for a social links menu with icons available for 26 different social accounts.</p>\n<p>Check out a <a href="https://dyaddemo.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">live demo</a> of Dyad on WordPress.com to see the theme in action.</p>\n<p>One consideration for using the theme is that you will always need to have large-sized feature images readily available to maintain the design. The optimal size is 1800px x 1280px. This shouldn&#8217;t be a problem for photography, cooking, portfolio, or other image-heavy sites. However, if your content is more text-oriented with a few scattered images, you may want to select a different theme.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/dyad/" target="_blank">Dyad</a> is Automattic&#8217;s 87th free theme release on WordPress.org.

In the request for public comment, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/" target="_blank">White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB)</a> outlined two major goals for the new policy:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This policy requires that, among other things: (1) new custom code whose development is paid for by the Federal Government be made available for reuse across Federal agencies; and (2) a portion of that new custom code be released to the public as Open Source Software (OSS).</p></blockquote>\n<p>The pilot program proposed in the draft policy would require &#8220;covered agencies to release at least 20 percent of their newly-developed custom code, in addition to the release of all custom code developed by Federal employees at covered agencies as part of their official duties.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Specifically, the government is asking for feedback on a list of considerations regarding releasing custom code as open source. A few examples include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To what extent is the proposed pilot an effective means to fuel innovation, lower costs, benefit the public, and meet the operational and mission needs of covered agencies?</li>\n<li>Would a different minimum percentage be more or less effective in achieving the goals above?</li>\n<li>To what extent could this policy have an effect on the software development market? For example, could such a policy increase or decrease competition among vendors, dollar amounts bid on Federal contracts, or total life-cycle cost to the Federal Government?</li>\n<li>What opportunities and challenges exist in Government-wide adoption of an open source policy?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Encouraging developers to produce reusable code to be shared across federal agencies could significantly lower development costs and improve government efficiency. It could also promote transparency of the code quality produced by vendors and employees.</p>\n<p>After the embarrassing <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/10/silicon-valley-reacts-to-healthcaregov.html" target="_blank">debacle of Healthcare.gov</a>, which cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars, it&#8217;s good to see government embracing open source in an expanded capacity.</p>\n<h3>How to Contribute</h3>\n<p>You can join the conversation by participating in discussions on the <a href="https://github.com/whitehouse/source-code-policy/issues" target="_blank">source code policy GitHub issues</a> or by logging a new issue. The White House even welcomes changes and line edits to the policy content via <a href="https://github.com/whitehouse/source-code-policy/edit/gh-pages/pages/index.md" target="_blank">pull requests</a>.</p>\n<p>Anyone can <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/source-code-policy" target="_blank">contribute on GitHub</a> to help shape the federal source code policy until April 11, 2016. At that time public contributions will be closed and the White House will analyze feedback while creating the final policy.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 15 Mar 2016 22:54:28 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"WPTavern: Shopify Launches Official Plugin for WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52450";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"http://wptavern.com/shopify-launches-official-plugin-for-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2620:"<p>Shopify <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/113145925-introducing-shopify-for-wordpress" target="_blank">announced</a> today that the company is jumping into the WordPress market with a new official plugin and three WordPress themes.

It allows users to sell products that have already been added to their Shopify stores and requires a $9/month Shopify Lite subscription.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/shopify-wp.gif" rel="attachment wp-att-52463"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/shopify-wp.gif?resize=975%2C549" alt="shopify-wp" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52463" /></a></p>\n<p>Shopify partnered with Themezilla, Themify, and Ultralinx to build Shopify-powered WordPress themes. The themes are only free to download for a limited time, which leaves users without updates unless they purchase the theme from the commercial provider.</p>\n<p>The corresponding plugin is currently hosted on GitHub but is in the process of being reviewed for WordPress.org, according to product representative Daniel Patricio.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Many users have already been using it through the themes for a couple weeks now so we just wanted to get it out there to the rest of our users,&#8221; Patricio said. &#8220;We are in the review cycle to get it listed and should be up shortly where people will be able to get updates as we add features.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It is not advisable to use or install the plugin until it is hosted on WordPress.org, as Shopify currently has no way to deliver security updates to users. It is unclear why the company chose to officially launch its new WordPress integration without updates in mind, but this is a major concern. If a vulnerability were discovered, the company has no straightforward way to alert people who have downloaded the plugin from GitHub.</p>\n<p>When asked for an ETA for the plugin&#8217;s arrival on WordPress.org, Patricio said, &#8220;We don&#8217;t have a timeline yet but will be getting it up there soon.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 15 Mar 2016 19:23:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:38:"Matt: What’s in My Bag, 2016 edition";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46172";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"https://ma.tt/2016/03/whats-in-my-bag-2016-edition/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13433:"<p>Many people have been requesting an update to <a href="https://ma.tt/2015/01/whats-in-my-bag-2014/">my what&#8217;s in my bag post from last year</a>.

It&#8217;s one of the reasons I took a month off from all things WordPress. According to <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/burnout">Merriam-Webster</a>, burnout is, &#8220;the condition of someone who has become very physically and emotionally tired after doing a difficult job for a long time.&#8221; Once burnout sets in, it&#8217;s tough to recover without avoiding the job completely.</p>\n<p>Drew Jaynes, WordPress core developer, describes how contributing to the WordPress project full-time <a href="http://werdswords.com/contributing-full-time-isnt-everyone/">led to burnout</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Here’s the thing: burnout is a real struggle. And when you’re working on something full-bore, 100 percent of the time, and you burnout, there aren’t a lot of good options to help combat that except to keep pressing on and try to get your groove back,&#8221; Jaynes said.</p>\n<p>Recognizing the signs that burnout is imminent is an important step towards avoiding it, &#8220;I typically realize I’m burned out when I basically lose interest in whatever thing I’d been previously passionate about. Burnout is the result of going at something too hard for too long. And then when you stop, getting started again is a struggle,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Jaynes realized it was time to move on from full-time contributing to something new after experiencing burnout three times in seven months. Although he will continue to contribute back to WordPress, it will be in a more limited role as he focuses on products.</p>\n<h2>How Matt Mullenweg Avoids Burnout</h2>\n<p>People combat burnout differently based on their individual circumstances. When asked <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/live/matt-mullenweg#comment-151645">how he combats burnout</a> in an <a href="http://wptavern.com/highlights-from-matt-mullenwegs-qa-session-on-product-hunt">Ask Me Anything segment</a> in September 2015, Matt Mullenweg, CEO of Automattic, responded:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Everything is connected, so if one of ( health | diet | relationships | family | work | soul | creative outlet ) is running on empty for too long, it will impact the others and you might end up treating the symptom rather than the cause. Recovery always comes from the people around you who give you unconditional love and support, which I&#8217;ve been lucky to have since I was an infant.</p>\n<p>To avoid it now I try to take small mini-breaks frequently, be that a ten minute meditation every day, jogging a few times a week, or taking a few days to recharge once a month. I find that&#8217;s better (and less stressful) than trying to do a big blow-out reset or vacation once a year. Conversely, a lot of times when people think I&#8217;m on vacation I&#8217;m actually working as much or more than when I&#8217;m at home, just from a more interesting location (often with fewer distractions). Funnily enough I&#8217;m more likely to actually take time off and unplug at home, and more likely to be working when in an exotic location.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I work for a company that has an unlimited vacation policy. I took advantage of it by taking a month off to clear my mind to help me refocus and it worked wonders for my mental well-being. If you feel it&#8217;s necessary and your employer has a similar policy, don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for some time off to regroup. What do you do to combat burnout? Please share your advice in the comments.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 14 Mar 2016 22:05:50 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Matt: Addicted to Distraction";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46355";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"https://ma.tt/2016/03/addicted-to-distraction/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:665:"<blockquote><p>Addiction is the relentless pull to a substance or an activity that becomes so compulsive it ultimately interferes with everyday life.

In addition to translating strings, organizers are also looking to grow the translation teams and educate new translators. They have identified the following three goals for the event:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Show people who are interested in translating WordPress in their language how to get involved</li>\n<li>Translate and validate the waiting strings for current projects under the supervision of the current General translation editors</li>\n<li>Add more general translation editors to different translation teams</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Global Translation Day is an ambitious undertaking that involves coordinating a 24-hour live stream of tutorials about translating WordPress in different languages, as well as local, on-site contributor teams.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Not very many people know how big the translation efforts around WordPress are, how dedicated our volunteer Translation Editors are to making sure we have quality, consistent software translations,&#8221; Polyglots contributor Petya Raykovska said. &#8220;We wanted the Global Translation Day to shed a bit of light on that and especially on the local teams.</p>\n<h3>Growing the WordPress Platform by Making it More Internationally Accessible</h3>\n<p>The Polyglots team is slowly chipping away at the world&#8217;s most widely spoken languages to provide core, theme, and plugin translations for users in their own languages.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have many languages that need a lot of help,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;Our Japanese, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese teams are amazing, these are active 100% translated locales,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But when it comes to plugin and theme translations, that’s where the demand is greatest.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On the other hand, we have languages that need help for WordPress core. All the Indian languages can use a huge push, our African and Asian languages need help.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The progress of each locale is tracked on the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/" target="_blank">Translation Teams</a> page, displaying the percentage of strings translated for each.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/translations.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52391"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/translations.png?resize=1025%2C395" alt="translations" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52391" /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Some of the biggest languages in the world are represented in this chart and if we got them to 100% that could have a huge impact on WordPress itself,&#8221; Raykovska said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you remember the big jump WordPress did in 2011 and then in 2014, when international downloads surpassed English downloads, half of those international downloads were for Japanese,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Now imagine what impact languages like Chinese, Hindi (and other Indian languages) and other languages in countries where English is not a default language, can have. The Global WordPress Translation day is about making WordPress accessible to more people and also about helping the platform’s growth,&#8221; Raykovska said.</p>\n<p>The Polyglots are calling all multilingual contributors to join in the event. Raykovska reports that so far they have more than 60 teams committing to take part, with 10 mini-contributor days held locally and more incoming. The Polyglots are also planning to host remote events where local teams use their own Slack channels to onboard contributors and work on translations.</p>\n<p>Contributors can choose from a number of ways to get involved. You can record a video in your language for the promotion clip, volunteer to do a live stream talk about translating WordPress into your language, organize a local contributor day, or get involved with the main organization.</p>\n<p>If you have the language skills to participate in the translation sprint, it&#8217;s one of the easiest ways to start contributing to WordPress and help prepare the platform for its next major international leap. Join #polyglots on Slack to connect with the team.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 14 Mar 2016 18:11:02 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:23:"Matt: Changelog Podcast";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46350";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"https://ma.tt/2016/03/changelog-podcast/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:575:"<p>I know a lot of people are on their way to SxSW right now, <a href="https://changelog.com/197/">here&#8217;s a podcast I joined called The Changelog you can download and check out on the way there</a> (or back).

This post is an assortment of items related to WordPress that caught my eye but didn&#8217;t make it into a full post.</p>\n<h2>Justin Tadlock Announces Simpler Pricing</h2>\n<p>Justin Tadlock <a href="http://themehybrid.com/weblog/simpler-pricing-for-theme-designer-and-plugin-developer">revamped his pricing</a> model for his <a href="http://themehybrid.com/plugins/plugin-developer">Plugin Developer</a> and <a href="http://themehybrid.com/plugins/theme-designer">Theme Designer</a> plugins. Based on two months of feedback, Tadlock removed the pricing tiers in favor of a single price. Both plugins are $90 and come with source files, one year of support, and access to the Theme Hybrid Slack channel.</p>\n<p>Existing customers have already been upgraded and can take advantage of the new perks. What&#8217;s nice is that Tadlock is giving those who purchased the plugins for $125 a partial refund of $35 to make up the difference.</p>\n<h2>Using WordPress to Break The Silence</h2>\n<p>Mahangu Weerasinghe, who works at Automattic as a Happiness Engineer, <a href="http://heropress.com/essays/breaking-the-silence/">published a fantastic essay</a> on HeroPress this week that describes how WordPress helped him break his silence. Weerasinghe suffers from stuttering and as a result, remained silent even if he had something to say. It&#8217;s an inspirational story and the best content I&#8217;ve read all week. There are many quotable spots in the post, but this is my favorite.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There are a lot of things we cannot control in this world, many forces at work that we cannot even see. But, as members of this community, I think we can content ourselves with this thought:</p>\n<p>Because of the GPL, and the way it works, WordPress will be available as a publishing platform for decades to come, and long after the next social network comes and goes, for as long as the Internet remains free and accessible, anyone with WordPress will be able to have their say.</p>\n<p>What WordPress did for me, it can do for others. And that’s why we need to keep going.</p>\n<p>Because every silence can be overcome.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Congrats Weerasinghe on defeating the silence and helping others to do the same.</p>\n<h2>Automattic Acquires Pressable</h2>\n<p>Automattic has purchased the rest of Vid Luther&#8217;s common stock shares in Pressable and has effectively <a href="https://poststatus.com/automattic-pressable/">acquired the company</a>. Chris Lauzon, a Happiness Engineer at Automattic, is the company&#8217;s interim CEO. Be sure to read Matt Mulleweng&#8217;s statement which clearly indicates to me that the company is not part of Automattic&#8217;s long-term interests.</p>\n<h2>Matt Mullenweg in The Irish Times</h2>\n<p>Ciara O&#8217;Brien <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/matt-mullenweg-how-wordpress-got-the-whole-world-blogging-1.2558828">interviewed Matt Mullenweg</a> when he visited Dublin, Ireland to speak at an Irish Software Association event. It&#8217;s one of the better interviews I&#8217;ve read in recent memory and if you know Matt well enough, you can tell which parts of the interview he showed his sense of humor.</p>\n<p>For example, when asked how he relaxes and switches off work mode, he responds &#8220;Well, this is lovely. We have tea and little cookies.” I can almost guarantee you that he chuckled while making that remark.</p>\n<h2>Introvert Reviews Pressnomics</h2>\n<p>Jeff Matson, who leads the documentation efforts for Rocketgenius, <a href="http://jeffmatson.net/realization-of-progress-and-success/">documented</a> (pun intended) his experience at Pressnomics 4. Thanks to his involvement in the community the past few years, people recognized him and started conversations with him instead of the other way around.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’m the nerd with the thick glasses, overgrown beard, and a hoodie; the guy who lives in a rather small apartment, drives a Kia, and shops at outlet malls. To put it simply, I’m your typical every-day middle-class 20-something guy. Certainly not the typically targeted clientele for such a high level business-centric conference.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Yet, he had a great time and strengthened relationships and created new ones with members of the community. As a friend, it&#8217;s great to see Jeff make large strides both in his professional and personal life.</p>\n<h2>Co-Organizing WordCamp Miami</h2>\n<p>David Bisset <a href="http://davidbisset.com/wordcamp-miami-2016-the-mega-review/">shares his experience</a> co-organizing one of the largest WordCamps in the US. According to a recent tweet, the team is already making plans for WordCamp Miami, FL 2017.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One of the reasons <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcmia?src=hash">#wcmia</a> organization team is so great: post-conference planning meetups. 2017 planning has begun. <a href="https://t.co/NZF31TRNOj">pic.twitter.com/NZF31TRNOj</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; David Bisset (@dimensionmedia) <a href="https://twitter.com/dimensionmedia/status/708282526477979650">March 11, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Wapuu of the North!</h2>\n<p>As a traditional part of this series, I end each issue by featuring a Wapuu design. For those who don&#8217;t know, Wapuu is the <a href="http://wapuu.jp/2015/12/12/wapuu-origins/">unofficial mascot</a> of the WordPress project. St. Patrick&#8217;s day is right around the corner, so what better way to celebrate than with a Wapuu with Irish roots. Meet, The Wapuu of the North.</p>\n<p>The Wapuu of the North was created by Peter of <a href="http://1440design.com/wordpress/branding-wordcamp-belfast/" target="_blank">1440 Design</a> for WordCamp Belfast, Ireland. This particular Wapuu has quite the head of hair!</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/belfast_wapuu.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-52005"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52005" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/belfast_wapuu.jpg?resize=1000%2C1000" alt="belfast_wapuu" /></a></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it for issue four.

OnePress was developed by the folks at <a href="https://www.famethemes.com/themes/onepress/" target="_blank">FameThemes</a> using <a href="http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap version 4</a>. It is suitable for business, portfolio, and agency websites.</p>\n<p>The theme features a full-screen background image with action buttons in the first major section.

In a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/03/09/comment-changes-in-wordpress-4-5/">post on the Make Core blog</a>, Rachel Baker explains the changes and what to expect.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress 4.5 includes several ancient bug fixes and a few enhancements in the Comments component. We have <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&component=Comments&milestone=4.5&group=resolution&col=id&col=summary&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=component&col=version&order=priority">closed 25 tickets</a>,&#8221; Baker said.</p>\n<p>The biggest change users will notice are the design improvements to the comment moderation screen when clicking one of the available links in a comment moderation email. Instead of appearing as a large block of plain-text, comments are formatted as long as they contain the following HTML elements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A &#8211; Links</li>\n<li>Abbr &#8211; Abbreviations</li>\n<li>Acronym &#8211; Defines an acronym</li>\n<li>B &#8211; Bold</li>\n<li>Blockquote &#8211; Specifies a section that is quoted from another source</li>\n<li>Cite &#8211; Defines the title of a work</li>\n<li>Code &#8211; Defines a piece of computer code</li>\n<li>Del &#8211; Defines text that has been deleted from a document</li>\n<li>Em &#8211; Emphasizes text</li>\n<li>I &#8211; Italicize</li>\n<li>Q &#8211; Defines a short quotation</li>\n<li>S &#8211; Specifies text that is no longer correct</li>\n<li>Strike &#8211; Defines strikethrough text</li>\n<li>Strong &#8211; Defines important text</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During testing, I noticed that in some cases, the text still appears in a large block as if the paragraph tag is ignored. I&#8217;ve already reported this issue to Baker who is looking into it. As you can see, the text that is bold, blockquoted, linked, and italicized, maintains its formatting on the moderation screen.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/CommentFormattingOnModerationScreen.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52346"><img class="size-full wp-image-52346" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/CommentFormattingOnModerationScreen.png?resize=1025%2C571" alt="Formatted Text On The Comment Moderation Screen" /></a>Formatted Text On The Comment Moderation Screen\n<p>In addition to visual enhancements, an Edit Comment link was added to the bottom of the comment. In the future, it would be nice to edit a comment in place during the moderation flow, similar to how Quick Edit works, instead of navigating to a different screen. Other notable changes include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated message styles that match other screens.</li>\n<li>The comment date is only wrapped in a link if the comment permalink exists.</li>\n<li><code>#wpbody-content</code> is appended to comment moderation email links for accessibility.</li>\n<li>The <code>rel=nofollow</code> attribute and value pair will no longer be added to relative or same domain links within <code>comment_content</code>.</li>\n<li><code>WP_Comment_Query</code> now supports the <code>author_url</code> parameter.</li>\n<li>The new <code>pre_wp_update_comment_count_now</code> filter allows you to bail out of updating the comment count for a given Post.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Maximum Comment Field Length</h2>\n<p>Those who publish lengthy comments will be happy to know that in WordPress 4.5, &#8220;the comment fields will enforce the maximum length of each field’s respective database column with hardcoded attributes. The hardcoded limits can be adjusted to accommodate custom database schemas using the <code>comment_form_default_fields</code> filter,&#8221; Baker said. By default, the limits are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Comment: 65525 characters</li>\n<li>Name : 245 characters</li>\n<li>Email: 100 characters</li>\n<li>Url: 200 characters</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When comments are submitted in 4.5, they&#8217;ll be checked by the new <code>wp_get_comment_fields_max_lengths()</code> function and the <code>wp_get_comment_fields_max_lengths</code> filter. If a value is more than the limit, a <code>WP_Error</code> is displayed. If a user publishes a comment and sees an error page, they&#8217;ll be able to navigate back to their comment via a link rather than having to use their browser&#8217;s back button.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/CommentErrorNavigation.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52347"><img class="size-full wp-image-52347" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/CommentErrorNavigation.png?resize=724%2C354" alt="Comment Error Page Navigation" /></a>Comment Error Page Navigation\n<p>It&#8217;s great that comments continue to receive attention, even if there&#8217;s a long way to go. Unfortunately, the ability to <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33717">send a notification email when a comment is approved from moderation</a> was punted to a future release. I&#8217;m looking forward to reviewing plugins that allow users to easily configure the comment length limits as seen above. It would be nice to configure the limits so spammers see an error message because of their comment&#8217;s length rather than being placed into the moderation queue.</p>\n<p>To see and test these improvements yourself, download and install <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/03/wordpress-4-5-beta-3/">WordPress beta 3</a> on a test site. If you think you’ve discovered a bug, please create a new post on the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta" target="_blank">Alpha/Beta area</a> of the support forums.

GitHub officially apologized for the lack of communication and promised to add new features and iterate on the core experience.</p>\n<p>Shortly after acknowledging the letter, GitHub <a href="http://wptavern.com/github-introduces-issue-and-pull-request-templates" target="_blank">introduced templates for issues and pull requests</a>, which allow project maintainers to guide contributors towards submitting more meaningful contributions.</p>\n<p>One of the other major requests included in the open letter was a voting system to declutter +1&#8217;s from issues. While the +1&#8217;s constitute valuable feedback, maintainers need a better UI to help make these conversations easier to read.</p>\n<p>GitHub has now answered this request by <a href="https://github.com/blog/2119-pull-request-and-issue-reactions" target="_blank">adding emoji reactions to pull requests, issues, and comments</a>. Emoji support is nothing new but organizing it into reactions helps keep comments more manageable:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In many cases, especially on popular projects, the result is a long thread full of emoji and not much content, which makes it difficult to have a discussion. With reactions, you can now reduce the noise in these threads.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Reactions are currently limited to six emoji that are commonly used in GitHub conversations:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/github-reactions.gif" rel="attachment wp-att-52312"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/github-reactions.gif?resize=917%2C359" alt="github-reactions" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52312" /></a></p>\n<p>Going forward, emoji reactions should make life easier for project maintainers, as they provide a quick way to assess consensus. If contributors embrace emoji reactions, the new feature can help maintainers gauge how widespread a bug is. They also serve to highlight the most helpful comments in a conversation.</p>\n<p>Emoji reactions, which were also recently adopted by Slack and Facebook, are making their way into more applications as an alternative way of offering feedback. Path was one of the first social apps to offer reactions in 2012. Buzzfeed has taken the feature to a new level with the addition of gif reaction options at the end of articles:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/buzzfeed-reactions.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52327"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/buzzfeed-reactions.png?resize=1025%2C601" alt="buzzfeed-reactions" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52327" /></a></p>\n<p>A feature that was once limited to social networks is now changing communication in the workplace by facilitating conversations for large groups of people. While emoji reactions offer people more ways of expressing themselves, they can also serve as a metric, a gauge, and a voting system.</p>\n<p>The new <a href="http://wptavern.com/new-feature-plugin-for-wordpress-adds-emoji-reactions-to-posts" target="_blank">Reactions feature plugin</a> for WordPress received no small amount of criticism when it was introduced earlier this week. Even if the plugin never reaches the proposal stage, the conversation about the value of emoji reactions in modern communication is worth having.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 11 Mar 2016 16:10:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"Matt: From Silence to Publishing";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46343";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:49:"https://ma.tt/2016/03/from-silence-to-publishing/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:722:"<blockquote><p>My parents first noticed my stutter when I was three years old.

A lot of people with dementia receive very good care but we just want everyone in Australia to receive the same level of care," she said.\r\n\r\n"There are often delays in diagnosis and part of that is that people often wait for some time before they go and see their local GP.\r\n\r\n"Another aspect of that is that there aren''t often good systems for detecting memory impairment," Dr Laver said.\r\n\r\nWhile diagnosing dementia can be difficult, the recommendations aim to make it easier by suggesting medical students and carers undergo specialised training.\r\n\r\n"There''s actually very little content in our undergraduate and postgraduate training courses about dementia so one of our recommendations is that there should be specific standalone content regarding dementia education," Dr Laver said.\r\n\r\n"There''s sometimes confusion about what''s cognitive decline associated with normal ageing and what''s cognitive decline which is dementia," she said.\r\n\r\n"We need to dismiss this belief that old people as they age will experience significant cognitive decline."\r\n\r\nSome of the key guidelines include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Timely diagnosis by recommending that symptoms are explored when first raised ... and are not dismissed as "just a part of ageing"</li>\r\n	<li>A systematic approach to diagnosing dementia [including] history taking, cognitive assessment, medication review, blood tests</li>\r\n	<li>A review of people with mild cognitive impairment after six to 18 months</li>\r\n	<li>Clinical cognitive assessment [including] examination with a screening tool with established reliability and validity</li>\r\n	<li>Families [being] included in the planning, decision making, care and management of people with dementia</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe guidelines also advise against prescribing anti-psychotic drugs to people with "mild to moderate behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia" because of the increased risk of adverse health effects and death.\r\n\r\n"We should be looking at non-drug treatments in the first instance," Dr Laver said.\r\n\r\n"In some circumstances, for the safety of both the staff and other residents in residential care, the only solution is anti-psychotics.\r\n\r\n"Most of the recommendations relate to care which isn''t new, which isn''t different, which isn''t expensive."\r\n\r\nAbout 380,000 Australians currently have dementia, including 9 per cent of those aged 65 and older.\r\n\r\nThe number is <a title="" href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-08/australians-with-dementia-expected-to-reach-almost-1-million/7228772" target="_self">expected to reach almost 1 million by 2050</a>.', 'Do you think the quality of dementia care in Australia is adequate?

I developed CareLinx to specifically solve many of the problems my family encountered while trying to find and manage home care for my sister with Multiple Sclerosis and uncle with ALS.\r\n\r\nAt one point my sister was quadriplegic and blind, and my uncle required total care 24 hours day, 7 days a week. We experienced the extreme of what families encounter when trying to manage home care for loved ones. We were referred to a couple of local agencies, but found the overall process was very inefficient and costly.\r\n\r\nTo complicate matters further, my mother lives in the San Francisco Bay Area while my sister lives in Los Angeles. This required my mother to constantly fly back and forth to help coordinate and manage my sister’s care. Currently, it is very difficult and costly for families to manage care for a loved one while holding a full-time job or living in a different city or state.\r\n\r\nAfter experiencing all the struggles my family endured, I became motivated to design an efficient and cost effective solution enabling families to easily find and manage home care for loved ones online.”', 'About', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '9-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-01-11 23:46:23', '2016-01-11 23:46:23', '', 9, 'http://care.gsqtest1.com/2016/01/11/9-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

We help save families thousands of dollars a year vs traditional agencies. Caregivers on CareNation have been background checked. You have access to copies of these background checks so you have the comfort of knowing that your loved one is in good hands.\r\n<h3><strong>How should I use CareNation?</strong></h3>\r\nGo to our home page and click on the ‘Find a Caregiver’ button.  Create your profile by filling out the online form.  Additionally, create a job description that describes your specific needs.\r\n<h3><strong>How much does it cost to use CareNation?</strong></h3>\r\nCareNation is saving families thousands of dollars a month vs a traditional agency. We currently charge either a 1, 3, 6 or 12 month subscription.  1 month starts at $99.  After a subscription has been purchased you may view caregivers full profile and you can post as many jobs as you wish. Caregivers set their own hourly rate and salary is negotiated between you and the caregiver.\r\n<h3><strong>How is CareNation different from traditional home care agencies or other home care services?</strong></h3>\r\nCareNation is not a home care agency. CareNation is an online platform that gives families the tools to easily find and manage caregivers that match their specific needs and budget.  CareNation helps families who can’t afford a traditional agency, which can charge in excess of a 75% markup on top of the caregiver salaries. While hiring a private caregiver does save families money there are a great deal of risks that need to be managed. Instead of hiring a caregiver through the classifieds or word of mouth referrals and sifting through resumes, you can easily find background checked caregivers with CareNation.  CareNation has the best of both worlds. We are not a typical agency so you work directly with caregivers, which means the hourly rates are lower and there is more flexibility.\r\n<h3><strong>Have your caregivers received background checks?</strong></h3>\r\nYes, all of our caregivers are required to have a valid police background check.  Background checks can be viewed on each caregivers profile.\r\n<h3><strong>Who determines the hourly rates of the caregivers?</strong></h3>\r\nCaregivers set their own hourly rate. They determine their hourly rate based on their experience, certifications, and education. The hourly rate on the profile of each caregiver can be seen as the minimum rate they are willing to work for. When a caregiver is hired, both the client and the caregiver agree on a fair hourly rate for that job.\r\n<h3><strong>How do I make payments?</strong></h3>\r\nPayments are made between yourself and the caregiver.', 'FAQs', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'faqs', '', '', '2016-02-24 04:33:33', '2016-02-24 04:33:33', '', 0, 'http://care.gsqtest1.com/?page_id=14', 0, 'page', '', 0),

When interacting with another User, CareNation recommends that Users exercise their discretion and judgment and remain cautious. When a User is meeting another User in person, CareNation recommends the following action be taken by the User, a minimum:\r\n\r\ni. check the identification of the other User;\r\n\r\nii. conduct your own background research in respect of the other User. If you are a Care Seeker, please be aware that whilst the Care Giver includes its police background check on the Profile, CareNation cannot guarantee the completeness, accuracy or reliability of the police background check;\r\n\r\niii. meet for the first time in a safe public place, during daylight hours;\r\n\r\niv. do not consume any alcohol at the meeting;\r\n\r\nv. take a friend or family member with you to the meeting;\r\n\r\nvi. if you are a Care Giver, provide a friend or family member with full details of where you will be providing the Care Giver Services;\r\n\r\nvii. if you are a Care Seeker, provide a friend or family member with full details of your Care Giver; and\r\n\r\nviii. do not share or exchange any personal information other than as reasonably necessary for the Care Giver to provide the Care Giver Services and/or financial details unless reasonably necessary to pay for the Care Giver Services. The above is a guideline only; it is not advice. Each User is solely responsible for ensuring its safety when meeting up with other Users and excludes CareNation from all liability in this regard.\r\n\r\n(f) CareNation is not responsible for the quality of services provided by third party service providers (including Veritas and Stripe) and assumes no liability for such. Any recourse a User has in respect of the services of a third party service provider is against the third party service provider directly.\r\n\r\n(g) By using the Site or Services, the User agrees that any legal remedy or liability that it seeks to obtain for actions or omissions of other Care Seekers or Care Givers or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the Care Seeker or Care Giver or other third party who caused it harm. CareNation encourages the User to communicate directly with the relevant Care Seeker or Care User on the Site and Services regarding any communications or arrangements made between them and to resolve any dispute between them.\r\n\r\n(h) To the fullest extent allowable under applicable law, CareNation disclaims all warranties, representations and conditions, whether express or implied, including any warranties, representations and conditions that the Site or Services are merchantable, of satisfactory quality, reliable, accurate, complete, suitable or fit for a particular purpose or need, noninfringing or free of defects or errors.\r\n\r\n(i) For the avoidance of doubt, CareNation is not responsible for any taxation, visa or immigration matters associated under these Terms. CareNation advises that all Users using the Site and Services should seek advice in relation to these matters.\r\n\r\n(j) Each Care Seeker and Care Giver who uses the Site and the Services do so at their own risk.\r\n\r\n(k) CareNation excludes all express and implied conditions and warranties, except for the User’s Rights, to the fullest extent permitted by law, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\ni. CareNation expressly disclaims any implied or express guarantees, warranties, representations or conditions of any kind, which are not stated in these Terms;\r\n\r\nii. CareNation does not warrant that the Site, the Services, content on the Site (including pictures, videos, sound clips, resumes, links etc.) or the User’s access to the Site or the Services will be error free, that any defects will be corrected or that the Site or the server which stores and transmits material to the User is free of viruses or any other harmful components;\r\n\r\niii. CareNation takes no responsibility for, and will not be liable for, the Site, the Services, the Care Seeker, the Care Giver and Care Giver Services being unavailable, failing to meet the Profile or Listing description, failing to meet the User’s needs, or of being less than merchantable quality; and\r\n\r\niv. CareNation will not be liable for any loss, damage, costs or expense whether direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential and/or incidental, exemplary or consequential damages, including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost of substitute products or services, or for any damages for personal or bodily injury or emotional distress, loss of revenue, production, opportunity, access to markets, goodwill, reputation, use or any indirect, remote, abnormal or unforeseeable loss, or any loss or damage relating to business interruption, loss of programs or other data on the User’s information systems or costs of replacement goods, or otherwise, suffered by the User or claims made against the User, arising out of or in connection with the Site, Services, Content, inability to access or use the Site, the Services, the Profile, the Care Giver Services, or the Terms, even if CareNation was expressly advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage.\r\n\r\n(l) The User agrees not to attempt to impose liability on, or seek any legal remedy from CareNation with respect to such actions or omissions.\r\n\r\n<strong>18. Limitation of Liability</strong>\r\n\r\n(a) CareNation’s total liability arising out of or in connection with the Site, the Services or the Terms, however arising, including under contract, tort, including negligence, in equity, under statute or otherwise, will not exceed the total fees paid by the User to CareNation in the twelve (12) month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or one hundred dollars (AUD$100) if no such payments have been made, as applicable.\r\n\r\n(b) The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between CareNation and the User. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to the User.\r\n\r\n(c) This limitation of liability reflects the allocation of risk between the parties. The limitations specified in this section will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in these terms is found to have failed of its essential purpose. The limitations of liability provided in these terms inure to the benefit of CareNation.\r\n\r\n<strong>19. Indemnity</strong>\r\n\r\n(a) Each User agrees to defend and indemnify and hold CareNation (and CareNations’s parent, related bodies corporate, officers, directors, contractors, employees and agents) harmless from and against any claims, actions, suits, demands, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including legal costs and expenses on a full indemnity basis), including in tort, contract or negligence, arising out of or connected to the User’s use of or access to the Services; any breach by the User of these Terms; any wilful, unlawful or negligent act or omission by the User; and any violation by the User of any applicable laws or the rights of any third party.\r\n\r\n(b) CareNation reserves the right to assume the exclusive defence and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by the User, in which event the User will cooperate in asserting any available defences.\r\n\r\n(c) This defence and indemnification obligation will survive these Terms and the User’s use of the Site or Services. These Terms, and any rights and licences granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by the User, but may be assigned by CareNation without restriction.\r\n\r\n<strong>20.

No waiver by CareNation of any of the Terms shall be effective unless CareNation expressly states that it is a waiver and CareNation communicates it to the User in writing.\r\n\r\n(g) Assignment: A User must not assign any rights and obligations under the Terms whether in whole or in part without CareNation’s prior written consent.\r\n\r\n(h) Severability: If any of the Terms are determined by any competent authority to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, such term, condition or provision will to that extent be severed from the remaining terms, conditions and provisions which will continue to be valid to the fullest extent permitted by law.\r\n\r\n(i) Jurisdiction and Applicable Law: These Terms, use of this Site, the Services and any dispute arising out of any User’s use of the Site or Services is subject to the laws of New South Wales, Australia, and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New South Wales courts.

CareNation requires Care Seekers and Care Givers to confirm that they have </span><span style="line-height: 1.75;">provided accurate information. Although CareNation requires Care Seekers to have a valid </span><span style="line-height: 1.75;">police background check in order to have a Profile on the Site, CareNation does not </span><span style="line-height: 1.75;">perform any independent background checks of Care Seekers or Care Givers, and does not </span><span style="line-height: 1.75;">confirm any Care Seekers or Care Giver’s identity, Profile, Listing or Care Giver Services.

CareNation disclaims any and all liability related to any </span><span style="line-height: 1.75;">and all Care Seekers, Care Givers, Profiles, Listings and Care Giver Services.</span>\n\n<span style="line-height: 1.75;">(e) All information on the Site or provided through the Services is for informational purposes </span><span style="line-height: 1.75;">only and is not intended to replace or substitute any professional, financial, medical, legal </span><span style="line-height: 1.75;">or other advice. CareNation expressly disclaims any and all liability concerning any </span>treatment, action by, or effect on any User following the information offered or provided within or through the Site or by its Users. Users should consult with an appropriately trained specialist for all health conditions and concerns that require professional or medical advice.\n\n(h) CareNation takes the safety of its Users very seriously. When interacting with another User, CareNation recommends that Users exercise their discretion and judgment and remain cautious. When a User is meeting another User in person, CareNation recommends the following action be taken by the User, a minimum:\n\ni. check the identification of the other User;\n\nii. conduct your own background research in respect of the other User. If you are a Care Seeker, please be aware that whilst the Care Giver includes its police background check on the Profile, CareNation cannot guarantee the completeness, accuracy or reliability of the police background check;\n\niii. meet for the first time in a safe public place, during daylight hours;\n\niv. do not consume any alcohol at the meeting;\n\nv. take a friend or family member with you to the meeting;\n\nvi. if you are a Care Giver, provide a friend or family member with full details of where you will be providing the Care Giver Services;\n\nvii. if you are a Care Seeker, provide a friend or family member with full details of your Care Giver; and\n\nviii. do not share or exchange any personal information other than as reasonably necessary for the Care Giver to provide the Care Giver Services and/or financial details unless reasonably necessary to pay for the Care Giver Services. The above is a guideline only; it is not advice. Each User is solely responsible for ensuring its safety when meeting up with other Users and excludes CareNation from all liability in this regard.\n\n(f) CareNation is not responsible for the quality of services provided by third party service providers (including Veritas and Stripe) and assumes no liability for such. Any recourse a User has in respect of the services of a third party service provider is against the third party service provider directly.\n\n(g) By using the Site or Services, the User agrees that any legal remedy or liability that it seeks to obtain for actions or omissions of other Care Seekers or Care Givers or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the Care Seeker or Care Giver or other third party who caused it harm. CareNation encourages the User to communicate directly with the relevant Care Seeker or Care User on the Site and Services regarding any communications or arrangements made between them and to resolve any dispute between them.\n\n(h) To the fullest extent allowable under applicable law, CareNation disclaims all warranties, representations and conditions, whether express or implied, including any warranties, representations and conditions that the Site or Services are merchantable, of satisfactory quality, reliable, accurate, complete, suitable or fit for a particular purpose or need, noninfringing or free of defects or errors.\n\n(i) For the avoidance of doubt, CareNation is not responsible for any taxation, visa or immigration matters associated under these Terms. CareNation advises that all Users using the Site and Services should seek advice in relation to these matters.\n\n(j) Each Care Seeker and Care Giver who uses the Site and the Services do so at their own risk.\n\n(k) CareNation excludes all express and implied conditions and warranties, except for the User’s Rights, to the fullest extent permitted by law, including but not limited to:\n\ni. CareNation expressly disclaims any implied or express guarantees, warranties, representations or conditions of any kind, which are not stated in these Terms;\n\nii. CareNation does not warrant that the Site, the Services, content on the Site (including pictures, videos, sound clips, resumes, links etc.) or the User’s access to the Site or the Services will be error free, that any defects will be corrected or that the Site or the server which stores and transmits material to the User is free of viruses or any other harmful components;\n\niii. CareNation takes no responsibility for, and will not be liable for, the Site, the Services, the Care Seeker, the Care Giver and Care Giver Services being unavailable, failing to meet the Profile or Listing description, failing to meet the User’s needs, or of being less than merchantable quality; and\n\niv. CareNation will not be liable for any loss, damage, costs or expense whether direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential and/or incidental, exemplary or consequential damages, including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost of substitute products or services, or for any damages for personal or bodily injury or emotional distress, loss of revenue, production, opportunity, access to markets, goodwill, reputation, use or any indirect, remote, abnormal or unforeseeable loss, or any loss or damage relating to business interruption, loss of programs or other data on the User’s information systems or costs of replacement goods, or otherwise, suffered by the User or claims made against the User, arising out of or in connection with the Site, Services, Content, inability to access or use the Site, the Services, the Profile, the Care Giver Services, or the Terms, even if CareNation was expressly advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage.\n\n(l) The User agrees not to attempt to impose liability on, or seek any legal remedy from CareNation with respect to such actions or omissions.\n\n18. Limitation of Liability\n\n(a) CareNation’s total liability arising out of or in connection with the Site, the Services or the Terms, however arising, including under contract, tort, including negligence, in equity, under statute or otherwise, will not exceed the total fees paid by the User to CareNation in the twelve (12) month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or one hundred dollars (AUD$100) if no such payments have been made, as applicable.\n\n(b) The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between CareNation and the User. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to the User.\n\n(c) This limitation of liability reflects the allocation of risk between the parties. The limitations specified in this section will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in these terms is found to have failed of its essential purpose. The limitations of liability provided in these terms inure to the benefit of CareNation.\n\n19. Indemnity\n\n(a) Each User agrees to defend and indemnify and hold CareNation (and CareNations’s parent, related bodies corporate, officers, directors, contractors, employees and agents) harmless from and against any claims, actions, suits, demands, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including legal costs and expenses on a full indemnity basis), including in tort, contract or negligence, arising out of or connected to the User’s use of or access to the Services; any breach by the User of these Terms; any wilful, unlawful or negligent act or omission by the User; and any violation by the User of any applicable laws or the rights of any third party.\n\n(b) CareNation reserves the right to assume the exclusive defence and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by the User, in which event the User will cooperate in asserting any available defences.\n\n(c) This defence and indemnification obligation will survive these Terms and the User’s use of the Site or Services. These Terms, and any rights and licences granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by the User, but may be assigned by CareNation without restriction.\n\n20.

No waiver by CareNation of any of the Terms shall be effective unless CareNation expressly states that it is a waiver and CareNation communicates it to the User in writing.\n\n(g) Assignment: A User must not assign any rights and obligations under the Terms whether in whole or in part without CareNation’s prior written consent.\n\n(h) Severability: If any of the Terms are determined by any competent authority to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, such term, condition or provision will to that extent be severed from the remaining terms, conditions and provisions which will continue to be valid to the fullest extent permitted by law.\n\n(i) Jurisdiction and Applicable Law: These Terms, use of this Site, the Services and any dispute arising out of any User’s use of the Site or Services is subject to the laws of New South Wales, Australia, and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New South Wales courts.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion\r\nor limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation\r\nmay not apply to the User.\r\n(c) This limitation of liability reflects the allocation of risk between the parties. The\r\nlimitations specified in this section will survive and apply even if any limited remedy\r\nspecified in these terms is found to have failed of its essential purpose. The limitations of\r\nliability provided in these terms inure to the benefit of CareNation.\r\n19.

Although CareNation requires Care Seekers to have a valid </span><span style="line-height: 1.75;">police background check in order to have a Profile on the Site, CareNation does not </span><span style="line-height: 1.75;">perform any independent background checks of Care Seekers or Care Givers, and does not </span><span style="line-height: 1.75;">confirm any Care Seekers or Care Giver’s identity, Profile, Listing or Care Giver Services.

Users should consult with an appropriately trained specialist for all health conditions and concerns that require professional or medical advice.\r\n\r\n(h) CareNation takes the safety of its Users very seriously. When interacting with another User, CareNation recommends that Users exercise their discretion and judgment and remain cautious. When a User is meeting another User in person, CareNation recommends the following action be taken by the User, a minimum:\r\n\r\ni. check the identification of the other User;\r\n\r\nii. conduct your own background research in respect of the other User. If you are a Care Seeker, please be aware that whilst the Care Giver includes its police background check on the Profile, CareNation cannot guarantee the completeness, accuracy or reliability of the police background check;\r\n\r\niii. meet for the first time in a safe public place, during daylight hours;\r\n\r\niv. do not consume any alcohol at the meeting;\r\n\r\nv. take a friend or family member with you to the meeting;\r\n\r\nvi. if you are a Care Giver, provide a friend or family member with full details of where you will be providing the Care Giver Services;\r\n\r\nvii. if you are a Care Seeker, provide a friend or family member with full details of your Care Giver; and\r\n\r\nviii. do not share or exchange any personal information other than as reasonably necessary for the Care Giver to provide the Care Giver Services and/or financial details unless reasonably necessary to pay for the Care Giver Services. The above is a guideline only; it is not advice. Each User is solely responsible for ensuring its safety when meeting up with other Users and excludes CareNation from all liability in this regard.\r\n\r\n(f) CareNation is not responsible for the quality of services provided by third party service providers (including Veritas and Stripe) and assumes no liability for such. Any recourse a User has in respect of the services of a third party service provider is against the third party service provider directly.\r\n\r\n(g) By using the Site or Services, the User agrees that any legal remedy or liability that it seeks to obtain for actions or omissions of other Care Seekers or Care Givers or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the Care Seeker or Care Giver or other third party who caused it harm. CareNation encourages the User to communicate directly with the relevant Care Seeker or Care User on the Site and Services regarding any communications or arrangements made between them and to resolve any dispute between them.\r\n\r\n(h) To the fullest extent allowable under applicable law, CareNation disclaims all warranties, representations and conditions, whether express or implied, including any warranties, representations and conditions that the Site or Services are merchantable, of satisfactory quality, reliable, accurate, complete, suitable or fit for a particular purpose or need, noninfringing or free of defects or errors.\r\n\r\n(i) For the avoidance of doubt, CareNation is not responsible for any taxation, visa or immigration matters associated under these Terms. CareNation advises that all Users using the Site and Services should seek advice in relation to these matters.\r\n\r\n(j) Each Care Seeker and Care Giver who uses the Site and the Services do so at their own risk.\r\n\r\n(k) CareNation excludes all express and implied conditions and warranties, except for the User’s Rights, to the fullest extent permitted by law, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\ni. CareNation expressly disclaims any implied or express guarantees, warranties, representations or conditions of any kind, which are not stated in these Terms;\r\n\r\nii. CareNation does not warrant that the Site, the Services, content on the Site (including pictures, videos, sound clips, resumes, links etc.) or the User’s access to the Site or the Services will be error free, that any defects will be corrected or that the Site or the server which stores and transmits material to the User is free of viruses or any other harmful components;\r\n\r\niii. CareNation takes no responsibility for, and will not be liable for, the Site, the Services, the Care Seeker, the Care Giver and Care Giver Services being unavailable, failing to meet the Profile or Listing description, failing to meet the User’s needs, or of being less than merchantable quality; and\r\n\r\niv. CareNation will not be liable for any loss, damage, costs or expense whether direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential and/or incidental, exemplary or consequential damages, including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost of substitute products or services, or for any damages for personal or bodily injury or emotional distress, loss of revenue, production, opportunity, access to markets, goodwill, reputation, use or any indirect, remote, abnormal or unforeseeable loss, or any loss or damage relating to business interruption, loss of programs or other data on the User’s information systems or costs of replacement goods, or otherwise, suffered by the User or claims made against the User, arising out of or in connection with the Site, Services, Content, inability to access or use the Site, the Services, the Profile, the Care Giver Services, or the Terms, even if CareNation was expressly advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage.\r\n\r\n(l) The User agrees not to attempt to impose liability on, or seek any legal remedy from CareNation with respect to such actions or omissions.\r\n\r\n<strong>18. Limitation of Liability</strong>\r\n\r\n(a) CareNation’s total liability arising out of or in connection with the Site, the Services or the Terms, however arising, including under contract, tort, including negligence, in equity, under statute or otherwise, will not exceed the total fees paid by the User to CareNation in the twelve (12) month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or one hundred dollars (AUD$100) if no such payments have been made, as applicable.\r\n\r\n(b) The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between CareNation and the User. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to the User.\r\n\r\n(c) This limitation of liability reflects the allocation of risk between the parties. The limitations specified in this section will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in these terms is found to have failed of its essential purpose. The limitations of liability provided in these terms inure to the benefit of CareNation.\r\n\r\n<strong>19. Indemnity</strong>\r\n\r\n(a) Each User agrees to defend and indemnify and hold CareNation (and CareNations’s parent, related bodies corporate, officers, directors, contractors, employees and agents) harmless from and against any claims, actions, suits, demands, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including legal costs and expenses on a full indemnity basis), including in tort, contract or negligence, arising out of or connected to the User’s use of or access to the Services; any breach by the User of these Terms; any wilful, unlawful or negligent act or omission by the User; and any violation by the User of any applicable laws or the rights of any third party.\r\n\r\n(b) CareNation reserves the right to assume the exclusive defence and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by the User, in which event the User will cooperate in asserting any available defences.\r\n\r\n(c) This defence and indemnification obligation will survive these Terms and the User’s use of the Site or Services. These Terms, and any rights and licences granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by the User, but may be assigned by CareNation without restriction.\r\n\r\n<strong>20.

No waiver by CareNation of any of the Terms shall be effective unless CareNation expressly states that it is a waiver and CareNation communicates it to the User in writing.\r\n\r\n(g) Assignment: A User must not assign any rights and obligations under the Terms whether in whole or in part without CareNation’s prior written consent.\r\n\r\n(h) Severability: If any of the Terms are determined by any competent authority to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, such term, condition or provision will to that extent be severed from the remaining terms, conditions and provisions which will continue to be valid to the fullest extent permitted by law.\r\n\r\n(i) Jurisdiction and Applicable Law: These Terms, use of this Site, the Services and any dispute arising out of any User’s use of the Site or Services is subject to the laws of New South Wales, Australia, and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New South Wales courts.

We help save families thousands of dollars a year vs traditional agencies. Caregivers on CareNation have been background checked. You have access to copies of these background checks so you have the comfort of knowing that your loved one is in good hands.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How should I use CareNation?</strong>\r\n\r\nGo to our home page and click on the ‘Find a Caregiver’ button.  Create your profile by filling out the online form.  Additionally, create a job description that describes your specific needs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How much does it cost to use CareNation?</strong>\r\n\r\nCareNation is saving families thousands of dollars a month vs a traditional agency. We currently charge either a 1, 3, 6 or 12 month subscription.  1 month starts at $99.  After a subscription has been purchased you may view caregivers full profile and you can post as many jobs as you wish. Caregivers set their own hourly rate and salary is negotiated between you and the caregiver.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How is CareNation different from traditional home care agencies or other home care services?</strong>\r\n\r\nCareNation is not a home care agency. CareNation is an online platform that gives families the tools to easily find and manage caregivers that match their specific needs and budget.  CareNation helps families who can’t afford a traditional agency, which can charge in excess of a 75% markup on top of the caregiver salaries. While hiring a private caregiver does save families money there are a great deal of risks that need to be managed. Instead of hiring a caregiver through the classifieds or word of mouth referrals and sifting through resumes, you can easily find background checked caregivers with CareNation.  CareNation has the best of both worlds. We are not a typical agency so you work directly with caregivers, which means the hourly rates are lower and there is more flexibility.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Have your caregivers received background checks?</strong>\r\n\r\nYes, all of our caregivers are required to have a valid police background check.  Background checks can be viewed on each caregivers profile.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Who determines the hourly rates of the caregivers?</strong>\r\n\r\nCaregivers set their own hourly rate. They determine their hourly rate based on their experience, certifications, and education. The hourly rate on the profile of each caregiver can be seen as the minimum rate they are willing to work for. When a caregiver is hired, both the client and the caregiver agree on a fair hourly rate for that job.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How do I make payments?</strong>\r\n\r\nPayments are made between yourself and the caregiver.', 'FAQs', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '14-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-01-19 00:02:59', '2016-01-19 00:02:59', '', 14, 'http://care.gsqtest1.com/14-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Caregivers set their own hourly rate and salary is negotiated between you and the caregiver.\r\n<h3><strong>How is CareNation different from traditional home care agencies or other home care services?</strong></h3>\r\nCareNation is not a home care agency. CareNation is an online platform that gives families the tools to easily find and manage caregivers that match their specific needs and budget.  CareNation helps families who can’t afford a traditional agency, which can charge in excess of a 75% markup on top of the caregiver salaries. While hiring a private caregiver does save families money there are a great deal of risks that need to be managed. Instead of hiring a caregiver through the classifieds or word of mouth referrals and sifting through resumes, you can easily find background checked caregivers with CareNation.  CareNation has the best of both worlds. We are not a typical agency so you work directly with caregivers, which means the hourly rates are lower and there is more flexibility.\r\n<h3><strong>Have your caregivers received background checks?</strong></h3>\r\nYes, all of our caregivers are required to have a valid police background check.  Background checks can be viewed on each caregivers profile.\r\n<h3><strong>Who determines the hourly rates of the caregivers?</strong></h3>\r\nCaregivers set their own hourly rate. They determine their hourly rate based on their experience, certifications, and education. The hourly rate on the profile of each caregiver can be seen as the minimum rate they are willing to work for. When a caregiver is hired, both the client and the caregiver agree on a fair hourly rate for that job.\r\n<h3><strong>How do I make payments?</strong></h3>\r\nPayments are made between yourself and the caregiver.', 'FAQs', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '14-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-02-24 04:33:33', '2016-02-24 04:33:33', '', 14, 'http://care.gsqtest1.com/14-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

I developed CareLinx to specifically solve many of the problems my family encountered while trying to find and manage home care for my sister with Multiple Sclerosis and uncle with ALS.\r\n\r\nAt one point my sister was quadriplegic and blind, and my uncle required total care 24 hours day, 7 days a week. We experienced the extreme of what families encounter when trying to manage home care for loved ones. We were referred to a couple of local agencies, but found the overall process was very inefficient and costly.\r\n\r\nTo complicate matters further, my mother lives in the San Francisco Bay Area while my sister lives in Los Angeles. This required my mother to constantly fly back and forth to help coordinate and manage my sister’s care. Currently, it is very difficult and costly for families to manage care for a loved one while holding a full-time job or living in a different city or state.\r\n\r\nAfter experiencing all the struggles my family endured, I became motivated to design an efficient and cost effective solution enabling families to easily find and manage home care for loved ones online.”', 'About Us', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '9-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-03-15 02:11:13', '2016-03-15 02:11:13', '', 9, 'http://care.gsqtest1.com/9-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
